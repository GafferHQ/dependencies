                          QTextDocument class, rather than by QString objects. 
                          Each QTextDocument object contains information about 
                          the document's internal representation, its structure, 
                          and keeps track of modifications to provide undo/redo 
                          facilities. This approach allows features such as the 
                          layout management to be delegated to specialized 
                          classes, but also provides a focus for the framework.""",

                          can done by an editor widget, such as QTextEdit, or by

                          There are two complementary ways to visualize the 
                          contents of a document: as a linear buffer that is 
                          used by editors to modify the contents, and as an 
                          object hierarchy containing structural information 
                          that is useful to layout engines. In the hierarchical 
                          model, the objects generally correspond to visual 
                          elements such as frames, tables, and lists. At a lower 
                          level, these elements describe properties such as the 
                          style of text used and its alignment. The linear 
                          representation of the document is used for editing and
