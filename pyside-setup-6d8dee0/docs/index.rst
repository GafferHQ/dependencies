Introduction
============

PySide is the Python Qt bindings project, providing access the complete Qt 4.8 framework
as well as to generator tools for rapidly generating bindings for any C++ libraries.

The PySide project is developed in the open, with all facilities you'd expect
from any modern OSS project such as all code in a git repository, an open
Bugzilla for reporting bugs, and an open design process. We welcome
any contribution without requiring a transfer of copyright.

The PySide reference documentation is hosted at
`http://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside/
<http://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside/>`_.


Compatibility
=============

PySide requires Python 2.6 or later and Qt 4.6 or better.

.. note::

   Qt 5.x is currently under construction.
