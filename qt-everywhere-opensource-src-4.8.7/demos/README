These demonstrations are intended to highlight Qt's capabilities in different
application areas, and provide examples that are more advanced than those in
the examples directory.

Beginners to Qt may wish to try out the Qt tutorial and some of the examples
before examining the demonstrations in detail.


The example launcher can be used to explore the different categories
available. It provides an overview of each example, lets you view the
documentation in Qt Assistant, and is able to launch examples.
