\class QAnimationState

\brief The QAnimationState class provides state that handle an animation and emit
a signal when this animation is finished.

\ingroup statemachine

QAnimationState provides a state that handle an animation. It will start this animation
when the state is entered and stop it when it is leaved. When the animation has finished the
state emit animationFinished signal.
QAnimationState is part of \l{The State Machine Framework}.

\code
QStateMachine machine;
QAnimationState *s = new QAnimationState(machine->rootState());
QPropertyAnimation *animation = new QPropertyAnimation(obj, "pos");
s->setAnimation(animation);
QState *s2 = new QState(machine->rootState());
s->addTransition(s, SIGNAL(animationFinished()), s2);
machine.start();
\endcode
