    \title Cross-Platform and Platform-Specific Development
	Qt allows you to write advanced applications and UIs once, and deploy them
	across desktop and embedded operating systems without rewriting the source
	code. The top section of this page provides an overview of the tools and
	techniques used in Qt application development. Still, you might want to add
	platform-specific features to your code. The bottom section of the page
	links to documents that describe platform-specific features provided by Qt,
	and discuss issues related to particular platforms and environments.

    \section1 Cross-Platform Development with Qt

    Qt is provided with a set of build tools to help developers automate
    the process of building and installing Qt applications.
