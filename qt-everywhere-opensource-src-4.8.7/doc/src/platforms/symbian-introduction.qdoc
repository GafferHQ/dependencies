    \title Symbian Platform Security Requirements
    \ingroup qtsymbian

    On Symbian, processes that access media via the network must
    have the \c NetworkServices platform security capability. If the client
    process lacks this capability, operations will result in errors.
    This failure is indicated by a state() of Phonon::ErrorState.

    Platform security capabilities are added via the
    \l{qmake-variable-reference.html#target-capability}{TARGET.CAPABILITY}
    qmake variable.

    \section1 Required Tools

    See \l{Qt for the Symbian platform Requirements} to see what tools are
    required to use Qt for the Symbian platform.

    \section1 Installing Qt and Running Demos

    Follow the instructions found in \l{Installing Qt for the Symbian platform} to learn how to install Qt using
    using source package and how to build and run the Qt demos.

    \section1 Building Your Own Applications

    If you are new to Qt development, have a look at \l{How to Learn Qt}.
    In general, the difference between developing a
    Qt application on the Symbian platform compared to any of the other platforms supported
    by Qt is not that big.

    Once you have created a \c .pro file for your project, generate the
    Symbian specific \c Bld.inf and \c .mmp files this way:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_symbian-introduction.qdoc 0

    For more information on how to use qmake have a look at the \l
    {qmake Tutorial}. In particular, see the
    \l{qmake Platform Notes#Symbian platform}{qmake Platform Notes} for
    details of Symbian-specific build settings.

    Now you can build the Qt for the Symbian platform application with
    standard build tools.

    \section2 Alternative Build Targets

    By default, running \c make will produce binaries for the emulator.
    However, the Symbian platform comes with several alternative
    build targets that can be used to create binaries for target hardware
    and deploy them on devices, as shown in the table below:

    \table
    \row \o \c debug-winscw  \o Build debug binaries for the emulator (default).
                                It is currently not possible to build release
                                binaries for the emulator.
    \row \o \c debug-gcce    \o Build debug binaries for hardware using GCCE.
    \row \o \c release-gcce  \o Build release binaries for hardware using GCCE.
    \row \o \c debug-armv5   \o Build debug binaries for hardware using RVCT.
    \row \o \c release-armv5 \o Build release binaries for hardware using RVCT.
    \row \o \c run           \o Run the application on the emulator.
    \row \o \c runonphone    \o Run the application on a device.
    \row \o \c deploy        \o Deploys the project into a device.
    \row \o \c sis           \o Create signed \c .sis file for project.
    \row \o \c unsigned_sis  \o Create unsigned \c .sis file for project.
    \row \o \c installer_sis \o Create signed \l{Smart Installer}{smart installer}
                                \c .sis file for project.
                                Smart installer will attempt to download
                                missing dependencies in addition to
                                just installing the application.
                                Note: The application \c .sis contained in smart installer \c .sis
                                will be recreated and signed with same certificates as
                                smart installer \c .sis.
    \row \o \c ok_installer_sis \o Otherwise similar to \c installer_sis target, except
                                the application sis will not be recreated. This is useful
                                when application \c .sis needs to be separately signed before
                                including it into smart installer \c .sis.
    \row \o \c unsigned_installer_sis \o Create unsigned \l{Smart Installer}{smart installer}
                                      \c .sis file for project.
                                      Note: The application \c .sis contained in smart installer
                                      \c .sis will also be unsigned.
    \row \o \c stub_sis      \o Create a stub sis to allow upgradability of projects
                                that are deployed in ROM
    \endtable

    The following lines perform a debug build for the emulator
    and deploy all the needed files:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_symbian-introduction.qdoc 1

    To work on your project in Carbide, simply import the \c .pro file
    by right clicking on the project explorer and executing "Import...".

    \section1 Running Applications from the Command Line

    The application can be launched on the emulator using \c{make run} command.

    The application can be launched on a device using \c{make runonphone} command.
    When this command is invoked, a \c .sis file is first created as if \c{make sis}
    command was invoked (see above for details).
    \bold{Note:} Running the application on a device using this command requires
    \c TRK application to be running on the device.

    Additional environment variables that can be utilized with these commands are:
    \table
    \row \o \c QT_RUN_OPTIONS           \o Any command line parameters you wish to pass
                                           to your application.
    \row \o \c QT_RUN_ON_PHONE_OPTIONS  \o Options for runonphone application.
                                           Execute \c runonphone from command line for
                                           more information about available options.
                                           \c{make runonphone} only.
    \endtable

    \section1 Installing Your Own Applications

    To install your own applications on hardware, you need a signed \c .sis file.
    (Refer to the \l{Symbian Platform Security} article for more informations about self-signing.)
    The signed \c .sis file can be created with \c make \c sis target. \c sis target
    is only supported for executables or projects with \c DEPLOYMENT statements.
    By default the \c sis target will create signed \c .sis file for last build
    target. For example, the following sequence will generate the needed makefiles,
    build the project for \c debug-winscw and \c release-armv5, and create
    self-signed \c .sis file for \c release-armv5 target:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_symbian-introduction.qdoc 2

    If you want to use different certificate information or override the default
    target for \c .sis file creation you can use the environment variables as
    shown in the table below:

    \table
    \row \o \c QT_SIS_OPTIONS      \o Options accepted by \c .sis creation. See
                                   \l{Supported options for QT_SIS_OPTIONS}{Supported options}
                                    below. By default no options are given.
    \row \o \c QT_SIS_TARGET       \o Target for which \c .sis file is created.
                                       Accepted values are build targets listed in
                                       previous table. By default last build target.
    \row \o \c QT_SIS_CERTIFICATE  \o The certificate file used for signing.
                                       By default self-signed certificate.
    \row \o \c QT_SIS_KEY          \o The certificate's private key file.
                                       By default key is associated to self-signed certificate.
    \row \o \c QT_SIS_PASSPHRASE   \o The certificate's private key file's passphrase.
                                       By default empty.
    \endtable

    The supported options for \c QT_SIS_OPTIONS:

    \target Supported options for QT_SIS_OPTIONS
    \table
    \row \o -i                  \o Install the package right away using PC suite.
    \row \o -p                  \o Only preprocess the template \c .pkg file.
    \row \o -c <file>           \o Read certificate information from a file.
    \row \o -u                  \o Preserves unsigned package.
    \row \o -o                  \o Creates only unsigned package.
    \row \o -s                  \o Generates stub sis for ROM.
    \row \o -n <name>           \o Specifies the final sis name.
    \row \o -g                  \o Treat gcce platform as armv5.
    \row \o -d                  \o Skip automatic patching of the package when default certificate is used.
    \endtable

    Execute the \c{createpackage.pl} script without any
    parameters for detailed information about options. By default no options are given.

    For example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_symbian-introduction.qdoc 4

    The environment variables for \c make can also be given as parameters:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_symbian-introduction.qdoc 3

    If you want to install the program immediately after creating \c .sis file,
    make sure that the device is connected to the computer in "PC Suite" mode,
    and use \c deploy target instead of \c sis target:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_symbian-introduction.qdoc 5

    \section1 Deployment and the Smart Installer

    Although some Symbian devices may already have a version of Qt installed
    on them, there needs to be a way to ensure that an appropriate version
    of Qt is available for your application to use. Rather than deploy the
    required Qt libraries with your application, the preferred way to
    package Qt applications for deployment is to download and use the Smart
    Installer.

    The Smart Installer makes sure that deployed applications have all the
    Qt dependencies they need to run on a device, performing the necessary
    updates when the user installs the application.

    More information about deployment can be found in the
    \l{Deploying an Application on the Symbian Platform} document.
