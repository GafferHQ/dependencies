    \title Window System Specific Notes
    \ingroup platform-specific
    \brief Collections of notes about Qt implementations on different window systems.

    Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, so almost the entire API is the
    same on all platforms and window systems. If you wish to use
    platform-specific features, and still maintain a platform-independent
    source tree, you should protect the platform-specific code using the
    appropriate \c{#ifdef} directives (see below).

    Qt provides a few low-level global functions for fine-tuning
    applications on specific platforms. See \l{Platform-Specific
    Functions} for details.

    \tableofcontents

    For information about which platforms are supported by Qt, see the
    \l{Platform and Compiler Notes}. For information on distributing Qt
    applications, see \l{Deploying Qt Applications}.

    \target x11
    \section1 Qt for X11

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_X11} is defined.

    \e{Not documented here. Please contact Qt's technical support team
    if you have queries.}

    See the \l{Qt for X11 Requirements} page for more information about the
    libraries required to build Qt with as many features as possible.

    \target win
    \section1 Qt for Windows

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_WIN} is defined.

    \e{Not documented here. Please contact Qt's technical support team
    if you have queries.}

    \target macosx
    \section1 Qt for Mac OS X

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_MAC} is defined.

    \i \l{Qt is Mac OS X Native}
    \endlist

    \target qws
    \section1 Qt for Embedded Linux

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_QWS} is
    defined (the window system is literally the Qt Window System). See
    the \l{Qt for Embedded Linux} documentation for more information.

    \section1 Qt for Windows CE

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_WINCE} is defined.
    See the \l{Qt for Windows CE} documentation for more information.

    \section1 Qt for the Symbian platform

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_S60} is defined.
    See the \l{The Symbian platform - Introduction to Qt} documentation for
    more information.
