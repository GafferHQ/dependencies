    \brief Documents related to Qt for Embedded Platforms.
    \ingroup platform-specific

    Qt is available for embedded platforms and devices as well as for a number
    of desktop platforms. The features provided for each platform depend on the
    capabilities and architecture of the operating system.

    Currently, three embedded platforms are supported by Qt:

    \header \o Embedded Linux \o Windows CE \o Symbian platform
    \row
    \o \l{Qt for Embedded Linux} is designed to be used on Linux devices
    without X11 or existing graphical environments. This flavor of
    Qt includes a framework for creating both applications and an
    environment for them. As a result, it includes features for
    window management, inter-process communication and facilities
    for handling input and display devices.
    \o \l{Qt for Windows CE} is used to create applications running in
    existing Windows CE and Windows Mobile environments.
    Applications use the appropriate style for the embedded
    environment and use native features, such as menus, to conform
    to the native style guidelines.
    \o \l{Qt for the Symbian platform} is used to create applications running
    in existing Symbian platform environments. Applications use the appropriate
    style for the embedded environment and use native features, such as menus,
    to conform to the native style guidelines.
