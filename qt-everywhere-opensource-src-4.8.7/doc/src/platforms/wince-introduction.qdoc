    \section1 Required tools

    In order to use Qt for Windows CE you need to have Visual Studio
    2005 or 2008 and at least one of the supported Windows
    CE/Mobile SDKs installed.
    Note, that the Visual Studio 2008 Standard Edition doesn't come
    with Windows CE support. You will need the Professional Edition,
    if you're using Visual Studio 2008.

    We recommend the \e{Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Pocket PC} SDK available
    \l{http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=83a52af2-f524-4ec5-9155-717cbe5d25ed&amp;DisplayLang=en}{here}.

    \section1 Installing Qt

    Follow the instructions found in \l{Installing Qt for Windows CE}.

    \section1 Building your own applications

    If you are new to Qt development, have a look at \l{How to Learn Qt}
    and \l{Tutorials}. In general there is little or no difference in
    developing Qt applications for Windows CE compared to any of the
    other platforms supported by Qt.

    Once you have a \c .pro file, there are two ways of building your
    application. You can either do it on the command line or inside of
    Visual Studio. To do it on the command line, simply write:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_wince-introduction.qdoc 0

    To build the project inside of Visual Studio, on the command line write:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_wince-introduction.qdoc 1

    then start Visual Studio with the generated \c .vcproj or \c .sln file and
    select \e{Build project}.

    For more information on how to use qmake have a look at the \l
    {qmake Tutorial}.

    \section1 Running the application

    In order to run the application, it needs to be deployed on the
    Windows CE/Mobile device you want to test it for. This can either
    be done manually or automated using Visual Studio.

    To do it manually, simply copy the executable, the Qt \c{.dll}
    files needed for the application to run, and the C-runtime library
    into a folder on the device, and then click on the executable to
    start the program. You can either use the \e Explorer found in
    ActiveSync or the \e{Remote File Viewer} found in Visual Studio to do
    this.

    Visual Studio can do this step automatically for you as well. If you have
    built the project inside Visual Studio, simply select \e Deploy and then
    \e Debug to deploy and then run the application. You can change the
    device type by changing the \e{Target Device} specified in the
    Visual Studio toolbar.

    Further information on deploying Qt applications for Windows can
    be found in the \l{Deploying an Application on Windows}
    {deployment document}.
