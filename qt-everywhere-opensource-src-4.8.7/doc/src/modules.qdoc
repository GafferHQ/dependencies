    \module QtOpenGL
    \title QtOpenGL Module
    \ingroup modules
	\ingroup technology-apis

    \brief The QtOpenGL module offers classes that make it easy to
    use OpenGL in Qt applications.

    OpenGL is a standard API for rendering 3D graphics. OpenGL only
    deals with 3D rendering and provides little or no support for GUI
    programming issues. The user interface for an OpenGL application
    must be created with another toolkit, such as Motif on the X
    platform, Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) under Windows, or Qt
    on both platforms.

    \note OpenGL is a trademark of Silicon Graphics, Inc. in
    the United States and other countries.

    The Qt OpenGL module makes it easy to use OpenGL in Qt applications.
    It provides an OpenGL widget class that can be used just like any
    other Qt widget, except that it opens an OpenGL display buffer where
    you can use the OpenGL API to render the contents.

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtopengl.cpp 0

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
    .pro file:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtopengl.pro 1

    The Qt OpenGL module is implemented as a platform-independent Qt/C++
    wrapper around the platform-dependent GLX (version 1.3 or later),
    WGL, or AGL C APIs. Although the basic functionality provided is very
    similar to Mark Kilgard's GLUT library, applications using the Qt
    OpenGL module can take advantage of the whole Qt API for
    non-OpenGL-specific GUI functionality.

    The QtOpenGL module is available on Windows, X11 and Mac OS X.
    \l{Qt for Embedded Linux and OpenGL} supports OpenGL ES (OpenGL for
    Embedded Systems).
    \note To be able to use the OpenGL API in \l{Qt for Embedded Linux}, it must be
    integrated with the Q Window System (QWS). See the
    \l{Qt for Embedded Linux and OpenGL} documentation for details.

/*!
    \module QtOpenVG
    \title QtOpenVG Module
    \since 4.6
    \ingroup modules
	\ingroup technology-apis

    \brief The QtOpenVG module is a plugin that provides support for
    OpenVG painting.

    OpenVG is a standard API from the
    \l{http://www.khronos.org/openvg}{Khronos Group} for accelerated
    2D vector graphics that is appearing in an increasing number of
    embedded devices.

    OpenVG support can be enabled by passing the \c{-openvg} option
    to configure. It is assumed that the following qmake variables
    are set to appropriate values in the qmake.conf file for your
    platform:

    \list
    \o QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENVG
    \o QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENVG
    \o QMAKE_LIBS_OPENVG
    \endlist

    Most OpenVG implementations are based on EGL, so the following
    variables may also need to be set:

    \list
    \o QMAKE_INCDIR_EGL
    \o QMAKE_LIBDIR_EGL
    \o QMAKE_LIBS_EGL
    \endlist

    See \l{qmake Variable Reference} for more information on these variables.

    Two kinds of OpenVG engines are currently supported: EGL based,
    and engines built on top of OpenGL such as
    \l{http://sourceforge.net/projects/shivavg}{ShivaVG}.
    EGL based engines are preferred.

    Once the graphics system plugin has been built and installed,
    applications can be run as follows to use the plugin:

    \code
    app -graphicssystem OpenVG
    \endcode

    If ShivaVG is being used, then substitute \c ShivaVG instead of
    \c OpenVG in the line above.

    These forms are processed at run-time to produce dynamically-generated

    \brief The QtTest module provides classes for unit testing Qt applications and libraries.

    Applications that use Qt's unit testing classes need to
    be configured to be built against the QtTest module.
    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qttest.cpp 0

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
    .pro file:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qttest.pro 1

    See the \l{QTestLib Manual} for a detailed introduction on how to use
    Qt's unit testing features with your applications.

    The QtTest module is part of all \l{Qt editions}.

    \target The QDBus compiler

    \brief The QtDBus module is a Unix-only library that you can use
    to perform Inter-Process Communication using the \l{D-Bus} protocol.

    Applications using the QtDBus module can provide services to
    other, remote applications by exporting objects, as well as use
    services exported by those applications by placing calls and
    accessing properties.

    The QtDBus module provides an interface that extends the Qt \l
    {signalsandslots.html}{Signals and Slots} mechanism, allowing one
    to connect to a signal emitted remotely as well as to connect a
    local signal to remote slot.

    To use this module, use the following code in your application:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtdbus.cpp 0

    If you're using qmake to build your application, you can add this
    line to your .pro file to make it link against the QtDBus
    libraries:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtdbus.pro 1

    \note The source code for this module is located in the \c{src/qdbus}
    directory. When installing Qt from source, this module is built when Qt's
    tools are built.

    See the \l {D-Bus} page for detailed information on
    how to use this module.

    This module is part of all \l{Qt editions}.

    If you do not use \l qmake or other build tools such as CMake, then you
    need to link against the \c qtmain library.
