    \title Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief License information for third-party libraries supplied with Qt.

    Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide
    certain features. Unlike the code described in the
    \l{Other Licenses Used in Qt}{code used in Qt} document, these
    libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules.

    Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the
    user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing
    requirements of the GPL, LGPL, or Qt Commercial license and the relevant
    license of the Third Party Software they are using.

    Run \c{configure -help} to see any options that may be available for
    controlling the use of these libraries.

    Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can
    normally be found by reviewing the change history of the
    corresponding files in the public Qt repository.

    See also the files in \c src/3rdparty/harfbuzz, which are used by
    FreeType.

    Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt
    for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h,
    ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications
    has been made to these files:

    \list
    \i Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name
    conflicts.
    \i Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with
    _STANDALONE_ defined.
    \i Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling
    rules.
    \i Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even
    polygon fill rules.
    \i Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c

    \section1 The Public Suffix List

    \e{The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is
       maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any
       software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser
       manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:}
    \list
    \o \e{Avoid privacy-damaging "supercookies" being set for high-level
          domain name suffixes}
    \o \e{Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user
          interface}
    \o \e{Accurately sort history entries by site}
    \endlist
    -- quoted from \l{publicsuffix.org}.

    The public suffix list is used inside Qt to avoid such "supercookies"
    mentioned above being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the
    QNetworkCookieJar class).

    See \c src/network/access/qnetworkcookiejartlds_p.h.INFO for more
    information about how the list is used.
