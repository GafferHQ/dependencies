    \title Other Licenses Used in Qt
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief Information about other licenses used for Qt components and third-party code.

    Qt contains some code that is not provided under the
    \l{GNU General Public License (GPL)},
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)} or the
    \l{Qt Commercial Edition}{Qt Commercial License Agreement}, but rather under
    specific licenses from the original authors. Some pieces of code were developed
    by Nokia and others originated from third parties.
    This page lists the licenses used, names the authors, and links
    to the places where it is used.

    Nokia gratefully acknowledges these and other contributions
    to Qt. We recommend that programs that use Qt also acknowledge
    these contributions, and quote these license statements in an
    appendix to the documentation.

    Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt
    for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h,
    ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications
    has been made to these files:

    \list
    \i Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name
    conflicts in \c{qrasterdefs_p.h}.
    \i Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with
    _STANDALONE_ defined.
    \i Changed behavior in \c{ftraster.c} to follow X polygon filling
    rules.
    \i Implemented support in \c{ftraster.c} for winding / odd even
    polygon fill rules.
    \i Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in \c{ftraster.c}.
    \i Renamed \c{ftraster.h} as \c{qblackraster_p.h}.
    \i Renamed \c{ftraster.c} as \c{qblackraster.c}.
