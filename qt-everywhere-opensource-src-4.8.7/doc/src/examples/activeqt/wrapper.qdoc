    \title Wrapper Example (ActiveQt)

    \brief The Wrapper example demonstrates how to export existing QWidget
    classes as ActiveX controls, and the use of QAxFactory together
    with the \c QAXFACTORY_EXPORT() macro.
    
    ActiveX controls in this
    example are the standard button classes QPushButton, QCheckBox
    and QRadioButton as provided by Qt.

    \snippet examples/activeqt/wrapper/main.cpp 0
    The factory implementation returns the list of supported controls,
    creates controls on request and provides information about the unique
    IDs of the COM classes and interfaces for each control.

    \snippet examples/activeqt/wrapper/main.cpp 1
    The factory is exported using the QAXFACTORY_EXPORT macro.

    To build the example you must first build the QAxServer library.
    Then run \c qmake and your make tool in \c
    examples/activeqt/wrapper.

    The \l{qaxserver-demo-wrapper.html}{demonstration} requires a
    web browser that supports ActiveX controls, and scripting to be
    enabled.
