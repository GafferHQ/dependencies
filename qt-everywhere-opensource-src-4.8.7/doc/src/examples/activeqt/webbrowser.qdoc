    \title Web Browser Example (ActiveQt)

    \brief The Web Browser example uses the Microsoft Web Browser
    ActiveX control to implement a fully functional Web Browser
    application. The user interface has been developed using the Qt
    Designer integration of the QAxWidget class.

    The code demonstrates how the Qt application can communicate 
    with the embedded ActiveX controls using signals, slots and the 
    dynamicCall() function.

    The \c MainWindow class declares a \c QMainWindow based user interface,
    using the \c Ui::MainWindow class generated by Qt Designer. A number
    of slots are implemented to handle events from the various user 
    interface elements, including the \c WebBrowser object, which is a
    QAxWidget hosting the Microsoft Web Browser control.

    The constructor initializes the user interface, installs a
    progress bar on the status bar, and uses QAxBase::dynamicCall()
    to invoke the \c GoHome() method of Internet Explorer to
    navigate  to the user's home page.

    Different slots handle the signals emitted by the WebBrowser object.

    Connections that don't require any coding, i.e. connecting the \c back 
    action to the \c GoBack() slot, have already been made in Qt Designer.

    The rest of the implementation is not related to ActiveQt - the actions
    are handled by different slots, and the entry point function starts the
    application using standard Qt APIs.

    To build the example you must first build the QAxContainer
    library. Then run your make tool in \c
    examples/activeqt/webbrowser and run the resulting \c
    webbrowser.exe.
