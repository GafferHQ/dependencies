    \title Menus Example (ActiveQt)

    The Menus example demonstrates the use of QMenuBar and QStatusBar
    in a QMainWindow to implement an in-place active control.

    To build the example you must first build the QAxServer library.
    Then run \c qmake and your make tool in \c
    examples/activeqt/menus.

    The \l{qaxserver-demo-menus.html}{demonstration} requires your
    WebBrowser to support ActiveX controls, and scripting to be
    enabled.
