    \title Books Demonstration

    \brief The Books demonstration shows how Qt's SQL classes can be used with the model/view
    framework to create rich user interfaces for information stored in a database.

    \image books-demo.png

    Information about a collection of books is held in a database. The books are
    catalogued by author, title, genre, and year of publication. Although each of
    these fields can be displayed and edited using standard widgets, an additional
    field describing an arbitrary rating for the book needs something extra.

    Books are rated using a system where each is allocated a number of stars; the
    more a book has, the better it is supposed to be. By clicking on a cell
    containing the rating, the number of stars can be modified, and the rating in
    the database is updated.
