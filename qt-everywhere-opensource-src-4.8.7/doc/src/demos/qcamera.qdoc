    \title QCamera Demo
    \example demos/mobile/qcamera

    \brief The QCamera demo shows how to use Multimedia, Messaging and Contacts modules from Qt Mobility.

    \image qcameraexample.png

    The application shows the viewfinder picture from the device camera and allows the user to capture images. Captured images are stored into the gallery and can be sent as an MMS message to a friend. Application listens for incoming MMS messages in the Inbox folder. If the MMS message contains a picture, the application asks the user whether he or she wants to add the picture as an avatar of the sender. The person's general contact information has to exist in the device phonebook in order to store the avatar in it.

    The application uses own MyVideoSurface video surface derived from QAbstractVideoSurface for showing camera view finder pictures. A video surface presents a continuous stream of identically formatted frames.
