Usage:

lrelease is part of Qt's Linguist tool chain. It can be used as a
stand-alone tool to convert XML-based translations files in the TS
format into the 'compiled' QM format used by QTranslator objects.

Options:
    -help  Display this information and exit
    -idbased
           Use IDs instead of source strings for message keying
    -compress
           Compress the QM files
    -nounfinished
           Do not include unfinished translations
    -removeidentical
           If the translated text is the same as
           the source text, do not include the message
    -markuntranslated <prefix>
           If a message has no real translation, use the source text
           prefixed with the given string instead
    -silent
           Do not explain what is being done
    -version
           Display the version of lrelease and exit
