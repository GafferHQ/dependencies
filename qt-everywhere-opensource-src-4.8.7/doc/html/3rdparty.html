<p>Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide certain features. Unlike the code described in the <a href="licenses.html">code used in Qt</a> document, these libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules.</p>
<p>Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing requirements of the GPL, LGPL, or Qt Commercial license and the relevant license of the Third Party Software they are using.</p>
<p>Run <tt>configure -help</tt> to see any options that may be available for controlling the use of these libraries.</p>
<p>Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can normally be found by reviewing the change history of the corresponding files in the public Qt repository.</p>

<h2>The Public Suffix List</h2>
<p><i>The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Avoid privacy-damaging &quot;supercookies&quot; being set for high-level domain name suffixes</i></li>
<li><i>Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface</i></li>
<li><i>Accurately sort history entries by site</i></li>
</ul>
<p>-- quoted from <a href="http://publicsuffix.org/">publicsuffix.org</a>.</p>
<p>The public suffix list is used inside Qt to avoid such &quot;supercookies&quot; mentioned above being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the <a href="qnetworkcookiejar.html">QNetworkCookieJar</a> class).</p>
<p>See <tt>src/network/access/qnetworkcookiejartlds_p.h&#x2e;INFO</tt> for more information about how the list is used.</p>
