Qt provides powerful document-oriented rich text engine that supports Unicode
and right-to-left scripts. Documents can be manipulated using a cursor-based
API, and their contents can be imported and exported as both HTML and in a
custom XML format.

Text is rendered using anti-aliased outline fonts to provide the best
possible on-screen representation.


The example launcher provided with Qt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
