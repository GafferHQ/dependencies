    // This example shows the same model in three different ListView items, 
    // with different highlight ranges. The highlight ranges are set by the 
    // preferredHighlightBegin and preferredHighlightEnd properties in ListView.
    //
    // The first ListView does not set a highlight range, so its currentItem
    // can move freely within the visible area. If it moves outside the
    // visible area, the view is automatically scrolled to keep the current
    // item visible.
    //
    // The second ListView sets a highlight range which attempts to keep the
    // current item within the the bounds of the range. However,
    // items will not scroll beyond the beginning or end of the view,
    // forcing the highlight to move outside the range at the ends.
    //
    // The third ListView sets the highlightRangeMode to StrictlyEnforceRange
    // and sets a range smaller than the height of an item.  This
    // forces the current item to change when the view is flicked,
    // since the highlight is unable to move.
    //
    // All ListViews bind their currentIndex to the root.current property.
    // The first ListView sets root.current whenever its currentIndex changes
    // due to keyboard interaction.
    // Flicking the third ListView with the mouse also changes root.current.
