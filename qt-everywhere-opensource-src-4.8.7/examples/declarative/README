The Qt Declarative module provides the ability to specify and implement
your user interface declaratively, using the Qt Meta-Object Language (QML). This
language is very expressive and human readable, and can be used by
designers to actually implement their UI vision. QML UIs can integrate
with C++ code in many ways, including being loaded as a part of a C++ UI
and loading data models from C++ and interacting with them.

The example launcher provided with Qt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory. But most can also be viewed directly with the
QML viewer utility, without requiring compilation.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorials and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.


Finding the Qt Examples and Demos launcher
==========================================

On Windows:

The launcher can be accessed via the Windows Start menu. Select the menu
entry entitled "Qt Examples and Demos" entry in the submenu containing
the Qt tools.

On Mac OS X:

For the binary distribution, the qtdemo executable is installed in the
/Developer/Applications/Qt directory. For the source distribution, it is
installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path specified when Qt is
configured.

On Unix/Linux:

The qtdemo executable is installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path
specified when Qt is configured.

On all platforms:

The source code for the launcher can be found in the demos/qtdemo directory
in the Qt package. This example is built at the same time as the Qt libraries,
tools, examples, and demonstrations.
