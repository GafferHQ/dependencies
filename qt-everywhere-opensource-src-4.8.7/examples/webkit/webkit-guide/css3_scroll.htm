<h3>Custom Scrollbars</h3>

<p>
Unlike standard text, linebreaks cannot appear arbitrarily within
blocks of code.  Wide lines may be difficult to read within a
narrow-screen mobile interface:

<pre>
window.onload = function() {
  var aside = document.querySelector('#related');
  document.querySelector('#main').addEventListener('mouseup', function(event){
    var thresholdDec = 0.5;
    var totalHeight = event.currentTarget.scrollHeight;
    var tapHeight = event.layerY;
    var tapHeightDec = tapHeight / totalHeight;
    var minHeight = 360;
    if ( tapHeight < minHeight ) aside.className = '';
    if (tapHeightDec > thresholdDec ) {
      aside.className = 'visible';
    }
    else {
      aside.className = '';
    }
  });
};
</pre>
