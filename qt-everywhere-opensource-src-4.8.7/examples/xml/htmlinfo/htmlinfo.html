    </head>
    <body>

    The XML HTML Info example provides a simple command line utility that
    scans the current directory for HTML files and prints statistics about
    them to standard out.

    \note Standard out is redirected on some platforms. On Symbian using Open
    C \c stdout is by default directed to the console window, but this window
    may not always be visible. To redirect to a file instead, locate the \c
    c:\\system\\data\\config.ini file (on either the emulator or the device)
    and change \c STDOUT to point to \c MEDIA4. This will redirect the console
    to \c c:\\system\\data\\out.txt.

    The files are parsed using a QXmlStreamReader object. If the file does
    not contain a well-formed XML document, a description of the error is
    printed to the standard error console.
