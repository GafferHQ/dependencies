This is the SVGA screen driver plugin example for QWS.

You may need to set the SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE environment
variable. These values have been confirmed to work on one specific
machine using svgalib 1.4.3: 18, 24, 34, 35, 36

There is a bug in the example causing missing updates in 8-bit mode
(e.g. modes 10 and 12). Fixing this bug is left as an exercise for the
reader.
