Qt supports native drag and drop on all platforms via an extensible
MIME-based system that enables applications to send data to each other in the
most appropriate formats.

Drag and drop can also be implemented for internal use by applications.


The example launcher provided with Qt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
