<p>The help system offers the possibility to filter all installed documentations
for certain <b>attributes</b>. Commonly specified attributes are e.g. the company
and product name as well as the product version.</p>
<p>The help engine and Assistant use <b>custom filters</b> to do the actual 
documentation filtering. A custom filter is basically just a alias name for a
list of filter attributes. So, if e.g. the custom filter "MyFilter" lists
the attributes "mycompany, myproduct" then only the documentation with those
attributes will be shown.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> The filter attributes are case sensitive!</p>
