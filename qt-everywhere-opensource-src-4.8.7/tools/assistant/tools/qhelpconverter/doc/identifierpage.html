<p><b>Identifiers</b> are mostly used to make keywords unique, but they can also
be used to specify keywords which should not be shown in the index. Identifiers
are especially help full when using context sensitive help and one keyword has
more links assigned to it.</p>
<p>E.g. consider the keyword "replace" in Qt. It is 
included, among others, in QString and QList. To be able to retrieve the proper
documentation, there is an identifier "QString::replace" and one
"QList::replace".</p>
<p>A <b>global prefix</b>, e.g. "MyApp::" is set for all keywords independent
where they are located. When <b>inheriting</b> the prefix from the file name,
the keywords get the prefix "[filename]::" where the file name is taken from the
reference of the keyword. The file name is just the base name, i.e. without any
directory or extension.</p>
