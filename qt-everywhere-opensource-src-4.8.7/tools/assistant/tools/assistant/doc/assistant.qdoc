    \chapter Introduction

    This document introduces \e{Qt Assistant}, a tool for presenting on-line
    documentation. It also introduces the Qt Reference Documentation which
    is accessible using \e{Qt Assistant}, or with a web browser. The document is
    divided into the following sections:

    Table of contents:

    \list
    \o \l{Introduction}
    \o \l{The One-Minute Guide to Using Qt Assistant}
    \o \l{Introduction to the Qt Reference Documentation}
    \o \l{Qt Assistant in More Detail}
    \o \l{Full Text Searching}
    \endlist

    \chapter The One-Minute Guide to Using Qt Assistant

    Once you have installed Qt, \QA should be ready to run:

    \list
    \o On Windows, \QA is available as a menu option on the Qt menu.
    \o On Mac OS X, \QA is installed in the /Developer/Applications/Qt directory.
    \o On Unix/Linux, open a terminal, type \c{assistant} and press \key{Enter}.
    \endlist

    When you start up \QA, you will be presented with a standard main window
    application, with a menu bar and toolbar. Below these, on the left hand
    side are navigation windows called \e{Contents}, \e{Index} and \e{Bookmarks}.
    On the right, taking up most of the space, is the \e{Documentation} window.
    By default, \QA loads the Qt reference documentation along with the manuals
    of other Qt tools, like \QD or \QL.

    \QA works in a similar way to a Web browser. If you click hyperlinks
    (cross-references), the \e{Documentation} window will present the relevant
    page. You can bookmark pages of particular interest and you can click the
    \gui{Previous} and \gui{Next} toolbar buttons to navigate within the pages
    you have visited.

    Although \QA can be used just like a Web browser to navigate through
    the documentation, \QA offers a powerful means of navigation that Web
    browsers do not provide. \QA uses an advanced full text search engine
    to index all the pages in each compressed help file so that you can
    search for particular words and phrases.

    To perform an index search, click the \gui{Index} tab on the Sidebar
    (or press \key{Alt+I}). In the \gui{'Look For'} line edit enter a word;
    e.g., 'homedirpath'. As you type, words are found and highlighted in a list
    beneath the line edit. If the highlighted text matches what you're
    looking for, double click it, (or press \key{Enter}) and the
    \e{Documentation} window will display the relevant page. You rarely have
    to type in the whole word before \QA finds a match. Note that for some
    words there may be more than one possible page that is relevant.

    \QA also provides full text searching for finding specific words in
    the documentation. To activate the full text search, either press \key(Alt+S)
    or click on the \gui{Search} tab in the \e{Documentation} window. Then
    enter the term you're looking for and hit the \gui{Search} button. All
    documents containing the specified term will then be listed in the list box
    below.

    \chapter Introduction to the Qt Reference Documentation

    The documentation for the Qt library is written in-line in the \c
    .cpp files by the developers themselves. The documentation team
    revises the documentation to ensure that it is accurate and usable,
    and to provide quality control. The documentation team also writes the
    larger texts, such as the class descriptions that introduce a class
    along with the concepts the class uses, as well as introducing the
    functions and properties that the class provides.

    The documentation focuses on the API rather than the internals, since
    we make great efforts to keep our API consistent and compatible with
    each new version, but we may change the internals considerably to improve
    performance and enhance functionality.

    The Qt Reference Documentation consists of almost 1,500 HTML pages
    (over 2,500 printed pages). The overwhelming majority of pages
    document Qt classes. Since developers differ in the way they
    think and work we provide a variety of approaches to navigating the
    documentation set:

    \list
    \i The \menu{Qt's Classes} page lists every class
    in Qt's public API, and consists of several hundred classes.
    \i The \menu{Qt's Main Classes} page lists the
    classes you're most likely to use most often, and provides a much
    shorter and more managable list than the All Classes list.
    \i The \menu{Grouped Classes} page presents a list
    of groups, each of which leads to a list of related classes, for
    example, the \menu{Advanced Widgets} list.
    \i The \menu{Class Inheritance Hierarchy} page
    presents a list of classes in terms of the hierarchy of Qt classes.
    \i The \menu{Member Function Index} page lists all the
    functions provided by Qt classes, each one with links to the class(es)
    in which it appears.
    \endlist

    No matter where you find yourself in the Qt documentation, you will
    find extensive cross-referencing. Even snippets of example code
    contain clickable links, so that for example, if you come across a
    class declaration in a code example, the class name will be a
    clickable link to the class's documentation.

    In addition to the class documentation some of Qt's modules have
    extensive descriptions, and there are many overview documents which
    describe various aspects of the Qt library; all these are linked from
    the reference documentation home page. There are also two tutorials
    and numerous example programs in the examples subdirectory of the Qt
    distribution.

    \section1 Command Line Options

    \QA handles the following command line options:

    \table
        \header
            \o Command Line Option
            \o Brief Description
        \row
            \o -collectionFile <file.qhc>
            \o Uses the specified collection file instead of the default one.
        \row
            \o -showUrl URL
            \o Shows the document referenced by URL.
        \row
            \o -enableRemoteControl
            \o Enables \QA to be remotly controlled.
        \row
            \o -show <widget>
            \o Shows the specified dockwidget which can be "contents", "index",
            "bookmarks" or "search".
        \row
            \o -hide <widget>
            \o Hides the specified dockwidget which can be "contents", "index",
            "bookmarks" or "search.
        \row
            \o -activate <widget>
            \o Activates the specified dockwidget which can be "contents",
            "index", "bookmarks" or "search.
        \row
            \o -register <doc.qch>
            \o Registers the specified compressed help file in the given help
            collection.
        \row
            \o -unregister <doc.qch>
            \o Unregisters the specified compressed help file from the given
            collection file.
        \row
            \o -quiet
            \o Doesn't show any error, warning or success messages.
    \endtable

    \section1 Tool Windows

    \img assistant-dockwidgets.png

    The tool windows provide four ways to navigate the documentation:

    \list
    \o The \gui{Contents} window presents a table of contents implemented as a
    tree view for the documentation that is available. If you click an item,
    its documentation will appear in the \e{Documentation} window. If you double
    click an item or click on the control to the left of it, the item's sub-items
    will appear. Click a sub-item to make its page appear in the \e{Documentation}
    window. Click on the control next to an open item to hide its sub-items.
    \o The \gui{Index} window is used to look up key words or phrases.
    See \l{The One-Minute Guide to Using Qt Assistant} for how to use this
    window.
    \o The \gui{Bookmarks} window lists any bookmarks you have made. Double
    click a bookmark to make its page appear in the \e{Documentation} window.
    The \gui{Bookmarks} window provides a context menu with \gui{Show Item},
    \gui{Delete Item} as well as \gui{Rename Item}. Click in the main menu
    \menu{Bookmark|Add Bookmark...} (or press \key{Ctrl+B}) to bookmark the
    page that is currently showing in the \e{Documentation} window. Right click
    a bookmark in the list to rename or delete the highlighted bookmark.
    \endlist

    If you want the \gui{Documentation} window to use as much space as possible,
    you can easily group, move or hide the tool windows. To group the windows,
    drag one on top of the other and release the mouse. If one or all tool
    windows are not shown, press \key{Alt+C}, \key{Alt+I} or \key{Alt+O} to show
    the required window.

    The tool windows can be docked into the main window, so you can drag them
    to the top, left, right or bottom of \e{Qt Assistant's} window, or you can
    drag them outside \QA to float them as independent windows.

    \section1 Documentation Window

    \img assistant-docwindow.png

    The \gui{Documentation} window lets you create a tab for each
    documentation page that you view. Click the \gui{Add Tab} button and a new
    tab will appear with the page name as the tab's caption. This makes it
    convenient to switch between pages when you are working with different
    documentation. You can delete a tab by clicking the \gui{Close Tab} button
    located on the right side of the \gui{Documentation} window.

    \section1 Toolbars

    \img assistant-toolbar.png

    The main toolbar provides fast access to the most common actions.

    \table
    \header \o Action \o Description \o Menu Item \o Shortcut
    \row \o \gui{Previous} \o Takes you to the previous page in the history.
         \o \menu{Go|Previous} \o \key{Alt+Left Arrow}
    \row \o \gui{Next} \o Takes you to the next page in the history.
         \o \menu{Go|Next} \o \key{Alt+Right Arrow}
    \row \o \gui{Home}
         \o Takes you to the home page as specified in the Preferences Dialog.
         \o \menu{Go|Home} \o \key{Ctrl+Home}.
    \row \o \gui{Sync with Table of Contents}
         \o Synchronizes the \gui{Contents} tool window with the page currently
            shown in the \gui{Documentation} window.
         \o \menu{Go|Sync with Table of Contents} \o
    \row \o \gui{Copy} \o Copies any selected text to the clipboard.
         \o \menu{Edit|Copy} \o \key{Ctrl+C}
    \row \o \gui{Print} \o Opens the \gui{Print} dialog.
         \o \menu{File|Print} \o \key{Ctrl+P}
    \row \o \gui{Find in Text} \o Opens the \gui{Find Text} dialog.
         \o \menu{Edit|Find in Text} \o \key{Ctrl+F}
    \row \o \gui{Zoom in}
         \o Increases the font size used to display text in the current tab.
         \o \menu{View|Zoom in} \o \key{Ctrl++}
    \row \o \gui{Zoom out}
         \o Decreases the font size used to display text in the current tab.
         \o \menu{View|Zoom out} \o \key{Ctrl+-}
    \row \o \gui{Normal Size}
         \o Resets the font size to its normal size in the current tab.
         \o \menu{View|Normal Size} \o \key{Ctrl+0}
    \endtable

    \img assistant-address-toolbar.png

    The address toolbar provides a fast way to enter a specific URL for a
    documentation file. By default, the address toolbar is not shown, so it
    has to be activated via \menu{View|Toolbars|Address Toolbar}.

    \img assistant-filter-toolbar.png

    The filter toolbar allows you to apply a filter to the currently installed
    documentation. As with the address toolbar, the filter toolbar is not visible
    by default and has to be activated via \menu{View|Toolbars|Filter Toolbar}.

    \section1 Menus

    \section2 File Menu

    \list
    \o \menu{File|Page Setup...} invokes a dialog allowing you to define
    page layout properties, such as margin sizes, page orientation and paper size.
    \o \menu{File|Print Preview...} provides a preview of the printed pages.
    \o \menu{File|Print...} opens the \l{#Print Dialog}{\gui{Print} dialog}.
    \o \menu{File|New Tab} opens a new empty tab in the \gui{Documentation}
    window.

    \o \menu{Go|Home} goes to the home page.
    \o \menu{Go|Back} displays the previous page in the history.
    \o \menu{Go|Forward} displays the next page in the history.
    \o \menu{Go|Sync with Table of Contents} syncs the \gui{Contents} tool window to the currently shown page.
    \o \menu{Go|Next Page} selects the next tab in the \gui{Documentation} window.
    \o \menu{Go|Previous Page} selects the previous tab in the \gui{Documentation} window.
    \endlist

    \section2 Bookmarks Menu

    \list
    \o \menu{Bookmarks|Add} adds the current page to the list of bookmarks.
    \endlist

    \section1 Dialogs

    \section2 Print Dialog

    This dialog is platform-specific. It gives access to various printer
    options and can be used to print the document shown in the current tab.

    \section2 Preferences Dialog

    \img assistant-preferences-fonts.png

    The \menu{Fonts} page allows you to change the font family and font sizes of the
    browser window displaying the documentation or the application itself.

    \img assistant-preferences-filters.png

    The \menu{Filters} page lets you create and remove documentation
    filters. To add a new filter, click the \gui{Add} button, specify a
    filter name in the pop-up dialog and click \gui{OK}, then select
    the filter attributes in the list box on the right hand side.
    You can delete a filter by selecting it and clicking the \gui{Remove}
    button.

    \img assistant-preferences-documentation.png

    The \menu{Documentation} page lets you install and remove compressed help
    files. Click the \gui{Install} button and choose the path of the compressed
    help file (*.qch) you would like to install.
    To delete a help file, select a documentation set in the list and click
    \gui{Remove}.

    \img assistant-preferences-options.png

    The \menu{Options} page lets you specify the homepage \QA will display when
    you click the \gui{Home} button in \QA's main user interface. You can specify
    the hompage by typing it here or clicking on one of the buttons below the
    textbox. \gui{Current Page} sets the currently displayed page as your home
    page while \gui{Restore to default} will reset your home page to the default
    home page.

    \section1 Find Text Control

    This control is used to find text in the current page. Enter the text you want
    to find in the line edit. The search is incremental, meaning that the most
    relevant result is shown as you enter characters into the line edit.

    If you check the \gui{Whole words only} checkbox, the search will only consider
    whole words; for example, if you search for "spin" with this checkbox checked it will
    not match "spinbox", but will match "spin". If you check the \gui{Case sensitive}
    checkbox then, for example, "spin" will match "spin" but not "Spin". You can
    search forwards or backwards from your current position in the page by clicking
    the \gui{Previous} or \gui{Next} buttons. To hide the find control, either click the
    \gui{Close} button or hit the \key{Esc} key.

    \section1 Filtering Help Contents

    \QA allows you to install any kind of documentation as long as it is organized
    in Qt compressed help files (*.qch). For example, it is possible to install the
    Qt reference documentation for Qt 4.4.0 and Qt 4.4.1 at the same time. In many
    respects, this is very convenient since only one version of \QA is needed.
    However, at the same time it becomes more complicated when performing tasks like
    searching the index because nearly every keyword is defined in Qt 4.4.0 as well
    as in Qt 4.4.1. This means that \QA will always ask the user to choose which one
    should be displayed.

    We use documentation filters to solve this issue. A filter is identified by its
    name, and contains a list of filter attributes. An attribute is just a string and
    can be freely chosen. Attributes are defined by the documentation itself, this
    means that every documentation set usually has one or more attributes.

    For example, the Qt 4.4.0 \QA documentation defines the attributes \c {assistant},
    \c{tools} and \c{4.4.0}, \QD defines \c{designer}, \c{tools} and \c{4.4.0}.
    The filter to display all tools would then define only the attribute
    \c{tools} since this attribute is part of both documentation sets.
    Adding the attribute \c{assistant} to the filter would then only show \QA
    documentation since the \QD documentation does not contain this
    attribute. Having an empty list of attributes in a filter will match all
    documentation; i.e., it is equivalent to requesting unfiltered documentation.

    \section1 Full Text Searching

    \img assistant-search.png

    \QA provides a powerful full text search engine. To search
    for certain words or text, click the \gui{Search} tab in the \gui{Documentation}
    window. Then enter the text you want to look for and press \key{Enter}
    or click the \gui{Search} button. The search is not case sensitive, so,
    for example, Foo, fOo and FOO are all treated as the same. The following are
    examples of common search patterns:

    \list
    \o \c deep -- lists all the documents that contain the word 'deep'
    \o \c{deep*} -- lists all the documents that contain a word beginning
    with 'deep'
    \o \c{deep copy} -- lists all documents that contain both 'deep' \e
    and 'copy'
    \o \c{"deep copy"} -- list all documents that contain the phrase 'deep copy'
    \endlist

    It is also possible to use the \gui{Advanced search} to get more flexibility.
    You can specify some words so that hits containing these are excluded from the
    result, or you can search for an exact phrase. Searching for similar words will
    give results like these:

    \list
    \o \c{QStin} -- lists all the documents with titles that are similar, such as \c{QString}
    \o \c{QSting} -- lists all the documents with titles that are similar, such as \c{QString}
    \o \c{QStrin} -- lists all the documents with titles that are similar, such as \c{QString}
    \endlist

    Options can be combined to improve the search results.

    The list of documents found is ordered according to the number of
    occurrences of the search text which they contain, with those containing
    the highest number of occurrences appearing first. Simply click any
    document in the list to display it in the \gui{Documentation} window.

    If the documentation has changed \mdash for example, if documents have been added
    or removed \mdash \QA will index them again.
