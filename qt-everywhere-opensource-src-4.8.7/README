This is Qt version 4.8.7.

Qt is a comprehensive cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt 4
introduces new features and many improvements over the 3.x series. See
http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qt4-intro.html for details.

The Qt 4.x series is not binary compatible or source compatible with
the 3.x series. For more information on porting from Qt 3 to Qt 4, see
http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/porting4.html.


INSTALLING Qt

If you have a source package (a .tar.gz, or .zip file), follow the
instructions in the INSTALL file.

On Windows and Mac OS X, if you want to install the precompiled binary
packages, simply launch the package and follow the instructions in the
installation wizard.

For Mac OS X Carbon, the binary package requires Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or
later and GCC 4.0.1 to develop applications. Its applications will run
on Mac OS X 10.4 and above.

For Mac OS X Cocoa, the binary package requires Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or
later and GCC 4.0.1 to develop applications.  Its applications will run
on Mac OS X 10.5 and above.


DEMOS AND EXAMPLES

Once Qt is installed, we suggest that you take a look at the demos and
examples to see Qt in action.

For desktop computers, run the Qt Examples and Demos either by
typing 'qtdemo' on the command line or through the desktop's Start
menu. On Mac OS X, you can find it in /Developers/Applications/Qt.

For embedded devices, launch the Qt 'fluidlauncher' demo, either through 
the platforms filebrowser or the built in menu system.


REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

The Qt reference documentation is available locally in Qt's doc/html
directory. You can use Qt Assistant to view it; to launch Assistant,
type 'assistant' on the command line or use the Start menu. On Mac OS
X, you can find it in /Developer/Applications/Qt.  The latest
documentation is available at http://doc.qt.io/.

HOW TO REPORT A BUG

If you think you have found a bug in Qt, we would like to hear about
it so that we can fix it.  The Qt bug tracking system is open to the
public at http://bugreports.qt.io/. Before reporting a bug, please use
the bug-tracker's search functions.

Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of Qt you are using, and what
configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run. Often,
such a program can be created with some minor changes to one of the many
example programs in Qt's examples directory, or to the autotests that
are available in the public source repository on http://code.qt.io/.
