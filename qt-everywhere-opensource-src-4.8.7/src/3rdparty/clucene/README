CLucene README
==============

------------------------------------------------------
CLucene is a C++ port of Lucene.
It is a high-performance, full-featured text search 
engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than lucene
as it is written in C++.

The latest version
------------------
Details of the latest version can be found on the CLucene sourceforge project
web site: http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/clucene

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is provided at http://clucene.sourceforge.net/doc/doxygen/html/
You can also build your own documentation by running doxygen from the root directory
of clucene.
CLucene is a very close port of Java Lucene, so you can also try looking at the
Java Docs on http://lucene.apache.org/java/


Performance
-----------
Very little benchmarking has been done on clucene. Andi Vajda posted some 
limited statistics on the clucene list a while ago with the following results.

There are 250 HTML files under $JAVA_HOME/docs/api/java/util for about
6108kb of HTML text. 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles with java and gcj: 
on mac os x 10.3.1 (panther) powerbook g4 1ghz 1gb:
    . running with java 1.4.1_01-99 : 20379 ms
    . running with gcj 3.3.2 -O2    : 17842 ms
    . running clucene 0.8.9's demo  :  9930 ms 

I recently did some more tests and came up with these rough tests:
663mb (797 files) of Guttenberg texts 
on a Pentium 4 running Windows XP with 1 GB of RAM. Indexing max 100,000 fields
• Jlucene: 646453ms. peak mem usage ~72mb, avg ~14mb ram
• Clucene: 232141. peak mem usage ~60, avg ~4mb ram

Searching indexing using 10,000 single word queries
• Jlucene: ~60078ms and used ~13mb ram
• Clucene: ~48359ms and used ~4.2mb ram

Platform notes
--------------

'Too many open files'
Some platforms don't provide enough file handles to run CLucene properly.
To solve this, increase the open file limit:

On Solaris:
ulimit -n 1024
set rlim_fd_cur=1024

Acknowledgments

The Apache Lucene project is the basis for this software, so the biggest
acknoledgment goes to that project.

CLucene relies heavily on the use of autoconf and libtool to provide
a build environment.
