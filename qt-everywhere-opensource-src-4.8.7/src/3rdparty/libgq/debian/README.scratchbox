This packages behaves a bit wierdly inside Scratchbox 1, by design.

When building it with dpkg-buildpackage or equivalent, it will disable
all devkits and adjust PATH.  This means that almost all build
dependencies will come from your installed packages, and not from
Scratchbox or the configured devkits.

Since some of our packages do not work with Scratchboxes fakeroot
(because the latter is too old), you should use the targets fakeroot
instead.

You can disable this behavior by setting SBOX_DONT_SANITIZE in the
environment.

When this package is build in a certain buildbot, it will go further
and permantly change the Scratchbox target.  This should not happen to
anyone but the buildbot, but there is a chance it will happen to you
by accident.

The buildbot is recognized via the $USER environment variable.  If it
matches "bifh[0-9]", the permanent changes will be done.

The permanent changes mostly consist of running apt-get dist-upgrade
and making sure that the targets fakeroot is used.
