- add a metadata function that returns a QVariant instead of a QString - useful for QImage or other binary (QByteArray) content

- QImage VideoWidget::screenshot(): ordinary screenshot doesn't work with XV says Christoph. And VideoDataOutput
  would be major overkill.

- consider whether to add a signal to notify when the information for
  availableAudioStreams/availableVideoStreams/availableSubtitleStreams
  is available

- look at collaboration with other projects, e.g. pavucontrol, gsmartmix

- consider Player dbus interface in MediaObject

- add global setting to pause video when it's not visible

- add a way to request a specific version (>=) from the Backend, so that known to be buggy Backends aren't used

- Video Overlays (OSD) like: show a rectangle as a play symbol, show the position in
  the file as something like [IIIIIIIII------], and so on

- http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147494

- frame/sample precise positioning (cue in/out)

- different timecode support like SMPTE

- Codec interface - at least for audio

- Speed factor for playback (useful mostly for audio - but video still needs to stay in sync)

- tell the platform plugin which backend was loaded (if it doesn't do it itself) so that it can load KDE translations for the backend
