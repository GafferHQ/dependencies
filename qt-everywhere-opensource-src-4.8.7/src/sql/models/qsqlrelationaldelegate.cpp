    \class QSqlRelationalDelegate
    \brief The QSqlRelationalDelegate class provides a delegate that is used to
    display and edit data from a QSqlRelationalTableModel.

    Unlike the default delegate, QSqlRelationalDelegate provides a
    combobox for fields that are foreign keys into other tables. To
    use the class, simply call QAbstractItemView::setItemDelegate()
    on the view with an instance of QSqlRelationalDelegate:

    \snippet examples/sql/relationaltablemodel/relationaltablemodel.cpp 4

    The \l{sql/relationaltablemodel}{Relational Table Model} example
    (shown below) illustrates how to use QSqlRelationalDelegate in
    conjunction with QSqlRelationalTableModel to provide tables with
    foreign key support.
