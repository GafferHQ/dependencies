    \class QAccessible
    \brief The QAccessible class provides enums and static functions
    relating to accessibility.

    \ingroup accessibility


    Accessible applications can be used by people who are not able to
    use applications by conventional means.

    The functions in this class are used for communication between
    accessible applications (also called AT Servers) and
    accessibility tools (AT Clients), such as screen readers and
    braille displays. Clients and servers communicate in the following way:

    \list
    \o  \e{AT Servers} notify the clients about events through calls to the
        updateAccessibility() function.

    \o  \e{AT Clients} request information about the objects in the server.
        The QAccessibleInterface class is the core interface, and encapsulates
        this information in a pure virtual API. Implementations of the interface
        are provided by Qt through the queryAccessibleInterface() API.
    \endlist

    The communication between servers and clients is initialized by
    the setRootObject() function. Function pointers can be installed
    to replace or extend the default behavior of the static functions
    in QAccessible.

    Qt supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), Mac OS X
    Accessibility, and the Unix/X11 AT-SPI standard. Other backends
    can be supported using QAccessibleBridge.

    In addition to QAccessible's static functions, Qt offers one
    generic interface, QAccessibleInterface, that can be used to wrap
    all widgets and objects (e.g., QPushButton). This single
    interface provides all the metadata necessary for the assistive
    technologies. Qt provides implementations of this interface for
    its built-in widgets as plugins.

    When you develop custom widgets, you can create custom subclasses
    of QAccessibleInterface and distribute them as plugins (using
    QAccessiblePlugin) or compile them into the application.
    Likewise, Qt's predefined accessibility support can be built as
    plugin (the default) or directly into the Qt library. The main
    advantage of using plugins is that the accessibility classes are
    only loaded into memory if they are actually used; they don't
    slow down the common case where no assistive technology is being
    used.

    Qt also includes two convenience classes, QAccessibleObject and
    QAccessibleWidget, that inherit from QAccessibleInterface and
    provide the lowest common denominator of metadata (e.g., widget
    geometry, window title, basic help text). You can use them as
    base classes when wrapping your custom QObject or QWidget
    subclasses.

                                            this event. It is not sent when an object is hidden as
                                            it is being obcured by others.
    \value ObjectReorder                    A layout or item view  has added, removed, or moved an
                                            object (Qt does not use this event).

                                            released the slider handle).
    \value ScrollingStart                   A scrollbar scroll operation is about to start; this may
                                            be caused by a mouse press on the slider handle, for
                                            example.
    \value SectionChanged

/*!
    \class QAccessibleInterface
    \brief The QAccessibleInterface class defines an interface that exposes information
    about accessible objects.

    \ingroup accessibility

    Accessibility tools (also called AT Clients), such as screen readers
    or braille displays, require high-level information about
    accessible objects in an application. Accessible objects provide
    specialized input and output methods, making it possible for users
    to use accessibility tools with enabled applications (AT Servers).

    Every element that the user needs to interact with or react to is
    an accessible object, and should provide this information. These
    are mainly visual objects, such as widgets and widget elements, but
    can also be content, such as sounds.

    The AT client uses three basic concepts to acquire information
    about any accessible object in an application:
    \list
    \i \e Properties The client can read information about
    accessible objects. In some cases the client can also modify these
    properties; such as text in a line edit.
    \i \e Actions The client can invoke actions like pressing a button
    or .
    \i \e{Relationships and Navigation} The client can traverse from one
    accessible object to another, using the relationships between objects.
    \endlist

    The QAccessibleInterface defines the API for these three concepts.

    \section1 Relationships and Navigation

    The functions childCount() and indexOfChild() return the number of
    children of an accessible object and the index a child object has
    in its parent. The childAt() function returns the index of a child
    at a given position.

    The relationTo() function provides information about how two
    different objects relate to each other, and navigate() allows
    traversing from one object to another object with a given
    relationship.

    \section1 Properties

    The central property of an accessible objects is what role() it
    has. Different objects can have the same role, e.g. both the "Add
    line" element in a scroll bar and the \c OK button in a dialog have
    the same role, "button". The role implies what kind of
    interaction the user can perform with the user interface element.

    An object's state() property is a combination of different state
    flags and can describe both how the object's state differs from a
    "normal" state, e.g. it might be unavailable, and also how it
    behaves, e.g. it might be selectable.

    The text() property provides textual information about the object.
    An object usually has a name, but can provide extended information
    such as a description, help text, or information about any
    keyboard accelerators it provides. Some objects allow changing the
    text() property through the setText() function, but this
    information is in most cases read-only.

    The rect() property provides information about the geometry of an
    accessible object. This information is usually only available for
    visual objects.

    \section1 Actions and Selection

    To enable the user to interact with an accessible object the
    object must expose information about the actions that it can
    perform. userActionCount() returns the number of actions supported by
    an accessible object, and actionText() returns textual information
    about those actions. doAction() invokes an action.

    Objects that support selections can define actions to change the selection.

    \section2 Objects and children

    A QAccessibleInterface provides information about the accessible
    object, and can also provide information for the children of that
    object if those children don't provide a QAccessibleInterface
    implementation themselves. This is practical if the object has
    many similar children (e.g. items in a list view), or if the
    children are an integral part of the object itself, for example, the
    different sections in a scroll bar.

    If an accessible object provides information about its children
    through one QAccessibleInterface, the children are referenced
    using indexes. The index is 1-based for the children, i.e. 0
    refers to the object itself, 1 to the first child, 2 to the second
    child, and so on.

    All functions in QAccessibleInterface that take a child index
    relate to the object itself if the index is 0, or to the child
    specified. If a child provides its own interface implementation
    (which can be retrieved through navigation) asking the parent for
    information about that child will usually not succeed.

    other object's \a otherChild. If \a child is 0 the object's own relation
    is returned.

    The returned value indicates the relation of the called object to
    the \a other object, e.g. if this object is a child of \a other
    the return value will be \c Child.

    The return value is a combination of the bit flags in the
    QAccessible::Relation enumeration.

/*!

    Returns the 1-based index of the child that contains the screen
    coordinates (\a x, \a y). This function returns 0 if the point is
    positioned on the object itself. If the tested point is outside
    the boundaries of the object this function returns -1.

    This function is only relyable for visible objects (invisible
    object might not be laid out correctly).

    All visual objects provide this information.

    \sa rect()

/*!
    \fn int QAccessibleInterface::navigate(RelationFlag relation, int entry, QAccessibleInterface
**target) const

    Navigates from this object to an object that has a relationship
    \a relation to this object, and returns the respective object in
    \a target. It is the caller's responsibility to delete *\a target
    after use.

    If an object is found, \a target is set to point to the object, and
    the index of the child of \a target is returned. The return value
    is 0 if \a target itself is the requested object. \a target is set
    to null if this object is the target object (i.e. the requested
    object is a handled by this object).

    If no object is found \a target is set to null, and the return
    value is -1.

    The \a entry parameter has two different meanings:
    \list
    \i \e{Hierarchical and Logical relationships} -- if multiple objects with
    the requested relationship exist \a entry specifies which one to
    return. \a entry is 1-based, e.g. use 1 to get the first (and
    possibly only) object with the requested relationship.

    The following code demonstrates how to use this function to
    navigate to the first child of an object:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_gui_accessible_qaccessible.cpp 0

    \i \e{Geometric relationships} -- the index of the child from
    which to start navigating in the specified direction. \a entry
    can be 0 to navigate to a sibling of this object, or non-null to
    navigate within contained children that don't provide their own
    accessible information.
    \endlist

    Note that the \c Descendent value for \a relation is not supported.

    All objects support navigation.

    \sa relationTo(), childCount()
*/

/*!
    \fn QString QAccessibleInterface::text(Text t, int child) const

    Returns the value of the text property \a t of the object, or of
    the object's child if \a child is not 0.

    The \l Name is a string used by clients to identify, find, or
    announce an accessible object for the user. All objects must have
    a name that is unique within their container. The name can be
    used differently by clients, so the name should both give a
    short description of the object and be unique.

    An accessible object's \l Description provides textual information
    about an object's visual appearance. The description is primarily
    used to provide greater context for vision-impaired users, but is
    also used for context searching or other applications. Not all
    objects have a description. An "OK" button would not need a
    description, but a tool button that shows a picture of a smiley
    would.

    The \l Value of an accessible object represents visual information
    contained by the object, e.g. the text in a line edit. Usually,
    the value can be modified by the user. Not all objects have a
    value, e.g. static text labels don't, and some objects have a
    state that already is the value, e.g. toggle buttons.

    The \l Help text provides information about the function and
    usage of an accessible object. Not all objects provide this
    information.

    The \l Accelerator is a keyboard shortcut that activates the
    object's default action. A keyboard shortcut is the underlined
    character in the text of a menu, menu item or widget, and is
    either the character itself, or a combination of this character
    and a modifier key like Alt, Ctrl or Shift. Command controls like
    tool buttons also have shortcut keys and usually display them in
    their tooltip.

    All objects provide a string for \l Name.
