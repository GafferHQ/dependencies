    \class QSound
    \brief The QSound class provides access to the platform audio facilities.

    \ingroup multimedia


    Qt provides the most commonly required audio operation in GUI
    applications: asynchronously playing a sound file. This is most
    easily accomplished using the static play() function:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_gui_kernel_qsound.cpp 0

    Alternatively, create a QSound object from the sound file first
    and then call the play() slot:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_gui_kernel_qsound.cpp 1

    Once created a QSound object can be queried for its fileName() and
    total number of loops() (i.e. the number of times the sound will
    play). The number of repetitions can be altered using the
    setLoops() function. While playing the sound, the loopsRemaining()
    function returns the remaining number of repetitions. Use the
    isFinished() function to determine whether the sound has finished
    playing.

    Sounds played using a QSound object may use more memory than the
    static play() function, but it may also play more immediately
    (depending on the underlying platform audio facilities). Use the
    static isAvailable() function to determine whether sound
    facilities exist on the platform. Which facilities that are
    actually used varies:

    \table
    \header \o Platform \o Audio Facility
    \row
    \o Microsoft Windows
    \o The underlying multimedia system is used; only WAVE format sound files
    are supported.
    \row
    \o X11
    \o The \l{ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/nas/}{Network Audio System}
    is used if available, otherwise all operations work silently. NAS
    supports WAVE and AU files.
    \row
    \o Mac OS X
    \o NSSound is used. All formats that NSSound supports, including QuickTime formats,
    are supported by Qt for Mac OS X.
    \row
    \o Qt for Embedded Linux
    \o A built-in mixing sound server is used, accessing \c /dev/dsp
    directly. Only the WAVE format is supported.
    \row
    \o Symbian
    \o CMdaAudioPlayerUtility is used. All formats that Symbian OS or devices support
    are supported also by Qt.
    \endtable

    Note that QSound does not support \l{resources.html}{resources}.
    This might be fixed in a future Qt version.
