    \brief The QPlatformWindow class provides an abstraction for top-level windows.

    The QPlatformWindow abstraction is used by QWidget for all its top level widgets. It is being
    created by calling the createPlatformWindow function in the loaded QPlatformIntegration
    instance.

    QPlatformWindow is used to signal to the windowing system, how Qt persieves its frame.
    However, it is not concerned with how Qt renders into the window it represents.

    Top level QWidgets(tlw) will always have a QPlatformWindow. However, it is not necessary for
    all tlw to have a QWindowSurface. This is the case for QGLWidget. And could be the case for
    widgets where some  3.party renders into it.

    The platform specific window handle can be retrieved by the winId function.

    QPlatformWindow is also the way QPA defines how native child windows should be supported
    through the setParent function.

    The only way to retrieve a QPlatformGLContext in QPA is by calling the glContext() function
    on QPlatformWindow.
