This graphics system uses ShivaVG (http://sourceforge.net/projects/shivavg)
to perform OpenVG rendering on X11 systems.  The graphics system name for
the "-graphicssystem" command-line option is "ShivaVG".

ShivaVG support is experimental, mostly to demonstrate how to integrate
non-EGL OpenVG engines into the system.  It will probably not produce
good output.
