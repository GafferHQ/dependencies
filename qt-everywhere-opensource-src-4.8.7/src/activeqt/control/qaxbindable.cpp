    \class QAxBindable
    \brief The QAxBindable class provides an interface between a
    QWidget and an ActiveX client.

    \inmodule QAxServer

    The functions provided by this class allow an ActiveX control to
    communicate property changes to a client application. Inherit
    your control class from both QWidget (directly or indirectly) and
    this class to get access to this class's functions. The
    \l{moc}{meta-object compiler} requires you to inherit from
    QWidget first.

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_activeqt_control_qaxbindable.cpp 0

    When implementing the property write function, use
    requestPropertyChange() to get permission from the ActiveX client
    application to change this property. When the property changes,
    call propertyChanged() to notify the ActiveX client application
    about the change. If a fatal error occurs in the control, use the
    static reportError() function to notify the client.

    Use the interface returned by clientSite() to call the ActiveX
    client. To implement additional COM interfaces in your ActiveX
    control, reimplement createAggregate() to return a new object of a
    QAxAggregated subclass.

    The ActiveQt \l{activeqt/opengl}{OpenGL} example shows how to use
    QAxBindable to implement additional COM interfaces.

    If the COM object supports a MIME type then this function is called

    Returns true to indicate success. If the function returns false,

    through the meta object system.

    \warning ActiveX controls embedded in HTML can use either the 
    \c type and \c data attribute of the \c object tag to read data,
    or use a list of \c param tags to initialize properties. If
    \c param tags are used, then Internet Explorer will ignore the

    Use the widget() method if you need to make calls to the QWidget
    implementing the ActiveX control. You must not store that pointer

    be destroyed by the ActiveQt framework at any time.
