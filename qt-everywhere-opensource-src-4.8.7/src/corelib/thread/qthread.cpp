    \class QThread
    \brief The QThread class provides a platform-independent way to
    manage threads.

    \ingroup thread

    A QThread object manages one thread of control within the
    program. QThreads begin executing in run(). By default, run() starts the
    event loop by calling exec() and runs a Qt event loop inside the thread.

    You can use worker objects by moving them to the thread using
    QObject::moveToThread().

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qthread.cpp worker

    The code inside the Worker's slot would then execute in a
    separate thread. However, you are free to connect the
    Worker's slots to any signal, from any object, in any thread. It
    is safe to connect signals and slots across different threads,
    thanks to a mechanism called \l{Qt::QueuedConnection}{queued
    connections}.

    Another way to make code run in a separate thread, is to subclass QThread
    and reimplement run(). For example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qthread.cpp reimpl-run

    In that example, the thread will exit after the run function has returned.
    There will not be any event loop running in the thread unless you call
    exec().

    It is important to remember that a QThread instance \l{QObject#Thread
    Affinity}{lives in} the old thread that instantiated it, not in the
    new thread that calls run(). This means that all of QThread's queued
    slots will execute in the old thread. Thus, a developer who wishes to
    invoke slots in the new thread must use the worker-object approach; new
    slots should not be implemented directly into a subclassed QThread.

    When subclassing QThread, keep in mind that the constructor executes in
    the old thread while run() executes in the new thread. If a member
    variable is accessed from both functions, then the variable is accessed
    from two different threads. Check that it is safe to do so.

    \note Care must be taken when interacting with objects across different
    threads. See \l{Synchronizing Threads} for details.

    \section1 Managing threads

    QThread will notifiy you via a signal
    when the thread is started(), finished(), and terminated(), or
    you can use isFinished() and isRunning() to query the state of
    the thread.

    You can stop the thread by calling exit() or quit(). In extreme
    cases, you may want to forcibly terminate() an executing thread.
    However, doing so is dangerous and discouraged. Please read the
    documentation for terminate() and setTerminationEnabled() for
    detailed information.

    From Qt 4.8 onwards, it is possible to deallocate objects that
    live in a thread that has just ended, by connecting the
    finished() signal to QObject::deleteLater().

    Use wait() to block the calling thread, until the other thread
    has finished execution (or until a specified time has passed).

    The static functions currentThreadId() and currentThread() return
    identifiers for the currently executing thread. The former
    returns a platform specific ID for the thread; the latter returns
    a QThread pointer.

    To choose the name that your thread will be given (as identified
    by the command \c{ps -L} on Linux, for example), you can call
    \l{QObject::setObjectName()}{setObjectName()} before starting the thread.
    If you don't call \l{QObject::setObjectName()}{setObjectName()},
    the name given to your thread will be the class name of the runtime
    type of your thread object (for example, \c "RenderThread" in the case of the
    \l{Mandelbrot Example}, as that is the name of the QThread subclass).
    Note that this is currently not available with release builds on Windows.

    QThread also provides static, platform independent sleep
    functions: sleep(), msleep(), and usleep() allow full second,
    millisecond, and microsecond resolution respectively.

    \note wait() and the sleep() functions should be unnecessary in
    general, since Qt is an event-driven framework. Instead of
    wait(), consider listening for the finished() signal. Instead of
    the sleep() functions, consider using QTimer.

/*!
    \fn Qt::HANDLE QThread::currentThreadId()

    Returns the thread handle of the currently executing thread.

    \warning The handle returned by this function is used for internal
    purposes and should not be used in any application code.

    \warning On Windows, the returned value is a pseudo-handle for the
    current thread. It can't be used for numerical comparison. i.e.,
    this function returns the DWORD (Windows-Thread ID) returned by
    the Win32 function getCurrentThreadId(), not the HANDLE
    (Windows-Thread HANDLE) returned by the Win32 function
    getCurrentThread().
*/

/*!
    \fn int QThread::idealThreadCount()

    Returns the ideal number of threads that can be run on the system. This is done querying
    the number of processor cores, both real and logical, in the system. This function returns -1
    if the number of processor cores could not be detected.

    if any. Note that the operating system decides to which thread to
    switch.

/*!
    \fn void QThread::start(Priority priority)

    Begins execution of the thread by calling run(). The
    operating system will schedule the thread according to the \a
    priority parameter. If the thread is already running, this
    function does nothing.

    The effect of the \a priority parameter is dependent on the
    operating system's scheduling policy. In particular, the \a priority
    will be ignored on systems that do not support thread priorities
    (such as on Linux, see http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched_setscheduler
