    \brief The QEventLoop class provides a means of entering and leaving an event loop.

    At any time, you can create a QEventLoop object and call exec()
    on it to start a local event loop. From within the event loop,
    calling exit() will force exec() to return.

    \enum QEventLoop::ProcessEventsFlag

    This enum controls the types of events processed by the
    processEvents() functions.

    \value AllEvents All events. Note that
    \l{QEvent::DeferredDelete}{DeferredDelete} events are processed
    specially. See QObject::deleteLater() for more details.

    \value ExcludeUserInputEvents Do not process user input events,
    such as ButtonPress and KeyPress. Note that the events are not
    discarded; they will be delivered the next time processEvents() is
    called without the ExcludeUserInputEvents flag.

    \value ExcludeSocketNotifiers Do not process socket notifier
    events. Note that the events are not discarded; they will be
    delivered the next time processEvents() is called without the
    ExcludeSocketNotifiers flag.

    \value WaitForMoreEvents Wait for events if no pending events are
    available.

    \omitvalue X11ExcludeTimers
    \omitvalue ExcludeUserInput
    \omitvalue WaitForMore
    \omitvalue EventLoopExec
    \omitvalue DialogExec
    \value DeferredDeletion deprecated - do not use.

    If \a flags are specified, only events of the types allowed by
    the \a flags will be processed.

    It is necessary to call this function to start event handling. The
    main event loop receives events from the window system and
    dispatches these to the application widgets.

    Generally speaking, no user interaction can take place before
    calling exec(). As a special case, modal widgets like QMessageBox
    can be used before calling exec(), because modal widgets
    use their own local event loop.

    To make your application perform idle processing (i.e. executing a
    special function whenever there are no pending events), use a
    QTimer with 0 timeout. More sophisticated idle processing schemes
    can be achieved using processEvents().
