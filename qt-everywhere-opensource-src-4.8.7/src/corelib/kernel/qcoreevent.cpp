    \class QEvent
    \brief The QEvent class is the base class of all
    event classes. Event objects contain event parameters.

    \ingroup events

    Qt's main event loop (QCoreApplication::exec()) fetches native
    window system events from the event queue, translates them into
    QEvents, and sends the translated events to \l{QObject}s.

    In general, events come from the underlying window system
    (spontaneous() returns true), but it is also possible to manually
    send events using QCoreApplication::sendEvent() and
    QCoreApplication::postEvent() (spontaneous() returns false).

    QObjects receive events by having their QObject::event() function
    called. The function can be reimplemented in subclasses to
    customize event handling and add additional event types;
    QWidget::event() is a notable example. By default, events are
    dispatched to event handlers like QObject::timerEvent() and
    QWidget::mouseMoveEvent(). QObject::installEventFilter() allows an
    object to intercept events destined for another object.

    The basic QEvent contains only an event type parameter and an
    "accept" flag.  The accept flag set with accept(), and cleared
    with ignore(). It is set by default, but don't rely on this as
    subclasses may choose to clear it in their constructor.

    Subclasses of QEvent contain additional parameters that describe
    the particular event.

    \sa QObject::event(), QObject::installEventFilter(),
        QWidget::event(), QCoreApplication::sendEvent(),
        QCoreApplication::postEvent(), QCoreApplication::processEvents()

    \value MaxUser                          Last user event ID.

    For convenience, you can use the registerEventType() function to
    register and reserve a custom event type for your
    application. Doing so will allow you to avoid accidentally
    re-using a custom event type already in use elsewhere in your
    application.

    \brief The QChildEvent class contains event parameters for child object

    Child events are sent immediately to objects when children are

    if QObject::isWidgetType() returns true, a QWidget). This is
    because in the QEvent::ChildAdded case the child is not yet fully
    constructed; in the QEvent::ChildRemoved case it might have
    already been destructed.

    The handler for these events is QObject::childEvent().

    \class QCustomEvent
    \brief The QCustomEvent class provides support for custom events.

    \compat

    QCustomEvent has a \c{void *} that can be used to store custom
    data.

    In Qt 3, QObject::customEvent() took a QCustomEvent pointer. We
    found out that this approach was unsatisfactory, because
    there was often no safe way of deleting the data held in the
    \c{void *}.

    In Qt 4, QObject::customEvent() takes a plain QEvent pointer.
    You can add custom data by subclassing.
