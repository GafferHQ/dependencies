This is the changelog for jom 1.1.2, the parallel make tool.

Changes since jom 1.1.1
- Fixed exit code propagation in xgejom.bat and ibjom.bat (QTCREATORBUG-16619).
- Updated the CMake build system to use Qt5.
- Fixed bogus path in error message for failed targets.
- Fixed error "JobClient destroyed while still acquiring." that could be yielded
  for failed builds.

Changes since jom 1.1.0
- Added the special .NOTPARALLEL target that disables parallel build for the
  containing makefile.

  possible. Includes like "foo.mk" did not recursively search through parent
  makefiles directories.

  JOMFLAGS is useful to set up separate flags for nmake and jom.
- Renamed ibjom.cmd to ibjom.bat for consistency.

Changes since jom 1.0.7
- Fix spawning of child processes that expect a valid stdin handle.
  E.g. xcopy couldn't be called anymore.
- CMakeList.txt was fixed (thanks to Ryan Pavlik).

Changes since jom 1.0.6
- Fix blank lines in output. (QTCREATORBUG-3974)
- Small performance improvement due to compilation with
  QT_USE_FAST_CONCATENATION and QT_USE_FAST_OPERATOR_PLUS.

- Handle quoted dollar signs in inline files correctly. (QTCREATORBUG-2875)
- Respect the MAKEFLAGS environment variable. (QTCREATORBUG-5028)

- Performance boost for incremental builds.
- Improved Ctrl-C handling for recursive make.

Changes since jom 1.0.2
- Support variable names with underscores. (QTCREATORBUG-3235)
- Keep order of dependencies on build. This is important for makefiles
  lacking complete dependencies. These might fail in parallel builds
  otherwise.

Changes since jom 1.0.1
- Make target names case insensitive. (QTCREATORBUG-3037)

  (QTBUG-15021)
- Repair the cmake project file for jom.

Changes since jom 1.0.0
- Cleaner and faster determination of targets that must be built.
- Fix incomplete up-to-date check for inference rule targets.
  (QTCREATORBUG-2713)
- Don't filter comments in inline files. (QTCREATORBUG-2874)

Changes since jom 0.9.4
- Inference rule batch mode implemented.
  This improves performance for makefiles that make heavy use of the batch
  mode, e.g. qmake generated makefiles.
- Improved command execution. No more batch file writing.
- Macro substitution implemented. Macro expansions like
  $(TARGET:suffix=d) are now possible.
- .SUFFIXES content is handled properly.
- Fixed several bugs in file name macro expansion.
- Output of concurrent processes is explicitely separated.

Changes since jom 0.9.3
- Opening files from volume mounted to NTFS directory fixed.
  (QTCREATORBUG-1475)
- Output buffering issue fixed. (QTBUG-10798)

Changes since jom 0.9.2
- Support for multiple inline files per command line added.
- Its now possible to use "." as target name. (QTCREATORBUG-1131)
- Support file name macros in the file name part of inline file defitions.
  (QTCREATORBUG-1136)
- Multiple file name macros per command line are possible now.
- Single name macro invocation was added.
  They can be invoked like this: $A instead of $(A).
- Several bugs related to file name macros have been fixed.
- Handle quoted arguments from command files correctly.

Changes since jom 0.9.1
- Fixed conditionals in preprocessor expressions. (QTCREATORBUG-1091)
- Improved parser error messages. Now we see the file, in which the
  error occurred. (QTCREATORBUG-1114)

Changes since jom 0.9.0
- Having too many rules for a target is now a warning and not an error.
- Fixed several bugs in the preprocessor expression parser, e.g.
  QTCREATORBUG-1056.

Changes since jom 0.8.9
- Reset the ERRORLEVEL to zero, if command's exit code should be ignored.
  (QTCREATORBUG-837)
- Command files can be used to pass command line options to jom.
  Usage: jom @commands.txt
- ANTLR isn't used anymore. We're using QLALR to generate the parser for
  preprocessor expressions now. This makes building jom much easier.
