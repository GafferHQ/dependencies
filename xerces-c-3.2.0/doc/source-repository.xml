  <s2 title="Overview">
    <p>The &XercesCName; source code is stored in the Subversion
       repository (SVN). The SVN repository is public and everyone
       has read access. The repository uses a standard layout of:</p>

<source>
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/c/
                                        |
                                        | - branches/
                                        |
                                        | - tags/
                                        \
                                          - trunk/
</source>

    <p>For example, to check out the trunk (the place where the main
       development is taking place), execute:</p>

<source>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/c/trunk
</source>

    <p>To check out the code in the xerces-3.1 branch (the place where
       the development for the next 3.1-series release, if any, is
       taking place), execute:</p>

<source>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/c/branches/xerces-3.1
</source>

    <p>To check out the code for the 3.2.0 release, execute:</p>

<source>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/c/tags/Xerces-C_3_2_0
</source>
