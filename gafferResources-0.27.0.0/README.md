# Gaffer Resources

This project contains resources such and caches and textures for use in Gaffer documentation and example scripts. It is needed as part of a Gaffer build, but managed in a separate repository to avoid bloat in the main code repository. Rather than use this repository directly, see the gafferDependencies project which bundles it with all other dependencies necessary to build Gaffer with a single command.
