<H2>Overview</H2>
The "Game of life" example demonstrates interoperability of TBB and .NET. 
<br>This program runs 2 simultaneous instances of the classic Conway's "Game of Life". 
One of these instances uses serial calculations to update the board. The other one calculates in parallel with TBB.
The visualization is written in managed C++ and uses .NET CLR.
