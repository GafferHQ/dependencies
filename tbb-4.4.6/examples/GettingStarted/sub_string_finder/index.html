<H2>Overview</H2>
<DL>
<DT>A simple example that uses the parallel_for template in a substring matching program. For each position 
in a string, the program displays the length of the largest matching substring elsewhere in the string. 
The program also displays the location of a largest match for each position.  Consider the string "babba" 
as an example. Starting at position 0, "ba" is the largest substring with a match elsewhere in the 
string (position 3). 
<DT>The code located in the <A HREF="sub_string_finder_extended.cpp">sub_string_finder_extended.cpp</A> file 
demonstrates offload programming for Intel&reg; Many Integrated Core (Intel&reg; MIC) Architecture (see <A HREF=../../index.html#build_4>build instructions</A>).
</DL>

<H2>Files</H2>
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="sub_string_finder.cpp">sub_string_finder.cpp</A>
<DD>The example as it appears in the Getting Started Guide.
<DT><A HREF="sub_string_finder_extended.cpp">sub_string_finder_extended.cpp</A>
<DD>An example similar to the one in the Getting Started Guide, but with an added sequential
    implementation, and with an offload region added that can be executed on Intel&reg; MIC Architecture based coprocessor.
    The three implementations are timed, by using tick_count,
    and the speedup of the parallel version and 
    the speedup of the parallel version and, if applicable, the offload version is calculated and displayed.
<DT><A HREF="sub_string_finder_pretty.cpp">sub_string_finder_pretty.cpp</A>
<DD>An example similar to the one in the Getting Started Guide, but with more attractive printing of the results.

<H2>Usage</H2>
<DL>
<DT><TT>sub_string_finder</TT>
<DD>Runs the example as it appears in the Getting Started Guide.
<DT><TT>sub_string_finder_pretty</TT>
<DD>Runs the similar example with more attractive printing of the results.
<DT><TT>sub_string_finder_extended</TT>
<DD>Runs the example extended with a sequential implementation and an offload region that can be executed on Intel&reg; MIC Architecture based coprocessor.
<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Threading Tools:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the <TT>sub_string_finder_pretty</TT> example
    (see the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>build directions</A>).
    <BR>Run it, e.g., <TT>sub_string_finder_pretty</TT>.
