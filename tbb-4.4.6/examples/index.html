<P>
Some of the following directions refer to a shell window; this refers
to the command prompt environment/window normally used on your system.
A shell might be a cmd.exe command prompt window (Windows* systems), or a
sh, bash, csh, ksh, etc. (or compatible) shell window (Windows*, Linux* or OS X* systems).
</P>

<A name="build_1"><H4>To build by using a Microsoft* Visual Studio* project (Windows* systems):</H4></A>
Perform the following steps:
<OL>
<LI>Identify the solution (*.sln) file for the example you wish to build and run. For Microsoft* Visual Studio* 2010, the *.sln file is in the example's msvs sub-directory.</LI>
<LI>Open the project by using one of the following methods:

    <LI>Invoke Microsoft* Visual Studio* from the Start menu and use the "Open Project" dialog to navigate to and open the project.</LI>
    </UL>
</LI>
<LI>Press &lt;ctrl-F5&gt; to build and run the example.</LI>
<li>If you copied an example to another place separately from libraries you need to
    set %TBBROOT% variable pointing to &lt;installdir&gt; folder.</li>
</OL>

<A name="build_2"><H4>To build by using a Xcode* IDE project (OS X* systems):</H4></A>
Perform the following steps:
<OL>

    <UL>
    <LI>The *.xcodeproj file is in the example's xcode sub-directory.
    </UL>
</LI>
<LI>Open the project by using one of the following methods:
    <UL>
    <LI>Navigate to the *.xcodeproj file by using the Finder.Double-click the *.xcodeproj file to invoke the Xcode* IDE and open the project.</LI>

</OL>

<A name="build_3"><H4>To build by using a Makefile (Windows*, Linux* or OS X* systems):</H4></A>
Perform the following steps:
<OL>
<LI>Open a shell window.  For Windows* systems, make sure this shell window has the proper environment
    defined for use with Microsoft* Visual Studio* (2010, 2012, 2013 or 2015); such a shell can be invoked
    from the Start menu, under Visual Studio, Visual Studio Tools, Visual Studio Command Prompt.
<LI>Set up the environment in this shell window for use with Intel TBB.
    <BR>See below for how to set up the environment for <A href="#env_1">Windows*</A>, <A href="#env_23">Linux*</A> or <A href="#env_23">OS X*</A> systems.
<LI>Unless you installed Intel TBB yourself, you may not have write permissions to the directory
    containing the example.  In this case, make a copy of the example, and use the copy for the following steps.
<LI>In the shell window, navigate to the directory for the example
    (or to the directory for the copy of the example if you made one in the previous step).
<LI>Use one or more of the following commands to build and run the example.
    Here, make refers to the make command normally used on your system: this could be
    nmake, gmake, or make on Windows* systems, or make or gmake on Linux* or OS X* systems.
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>make</TT>
    <DD>Default build and run.  Equivalent to 'make release test'.

<A name="env_1"><H4>To set up the environment (Windows* systems):</H4></A>
It is <B>strongly</B> recommended that the environment be set up when installing Intel TBB.
Do this by selecting the appropriate check-box during the install.  However, if the environment is not set up
during installation, or you wish to build for an alternate architecture or Microsoft* Visual Studio* version,
it may be set up, for a given type of shell window, by using one of the following commands:
<DL>
<DT>For cmd.exe (command prompt):
<DD><TT>&lt;<I>installdir</I>&gt;\bin\tbbvars.bat (arch) (vs)</TT>
<pre>
    where (arch) must be is one of the following
        ia32         : Set up for IA-32  architecture
        intel64      : Set up for Intel&reg; 64  architecture
    (vs) should be one of the following
        vs2010       : Set to use with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 runtime DLLs
        vs2012       : Set to use with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 runtime DLLs
        vs2013       : Set to use with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 runtime DLLs
        vs2015       : Set to use with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 runtime DLLs
        all          : Set to use TBB statically linked with Microsoft Visual C++ runtime
    if (vs) is not set TBB statically linked with Microsoft Visual C++ runtime will be used.
</pre>
</DL>
<A name="env_23">
    <H4>To set up the environment (Linux* or OS X* systems):</H4></A>
The environment may be set up, for a given type of shell window, by using one of the following commands:
<DL>
<DT>For sh, bash, ksh, dash (or compatibles):
<DD>. &lt;<I>installdir</I>&gt;/bin/tbbvars.sh (arch) [platform [TBBROOT_detection_mode]]
<DT>For csh (or compatibles):
<DD>source &lt;<I>installdir</I>&gt;/bin/tbbvars.csh (arch) [platform [TBBROOT_detection_mode]]
<DT><I>Notes:</I>
<DD><I><SL>
    <LI>(arch) argument represents target architecture. Its possible values are 'ia32' or 'intel64'.
    <LI>[platform] argument represents target platform. Its possible values are 'linux' or 'android'.
    <LI>[TBBROOT_detection_mode] argument represents TBBROOT path detection method. Its only possible value is 'auto_tbbroot'. In this case the environment variable TBBROOT is detected automatically by using the tbbvars script directory path.
    <LI>Environment setup need only be performed once per shell window to be used.
    <LI>Always source tbbvars.sh or tbbvars.csh rather than executing them directly.
    <LI>If the arguments to the sourced script are ignored (consult documentation for your shell) the alternative way to specify target is environment variables COMPILERVARS_ARCHITECTURE to pass (arch) to the script and COMPILERVARS_PLATFORM to pass [platform].
