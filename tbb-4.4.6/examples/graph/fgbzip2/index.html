<H2>Overview</H2>

fgbzip2 is a parallel implementation of bzip2 block-sorting file compressor that uses tbb::flow.
The output of this application is fully compatible with bzip2 v1.0.6 or newer.

<P><I>
This example includes software developed by Julian R Seward.  See
<A HREF=#copyright>here</A> for copyright information.
</I></P>

It exemplifies the async_node CPF, among others.

<p>This example uses C++11 lambda expressions. Specifying a compiler option such as -std=c++11 or similar might be necessary in order to build the example.
For more information please refer to the documentation for the compiler you use.</p>

<H2>Usage</H2>
<DL>

<DT><TT>fgbzip2 <I>-h</I></TT>
<DD>Prints the help for command line options
<DT><TT>fgbzip2 [<I>-b</I>=value] [<I>-q</I>] [<I>-v</I>] [<I>-a</I>] [<I>filename</I>]</TT>
<DD><I>-b</I> block size in 100 Kb chunks, [1 .. 9]<BR>
    <I>-q</I> limits output to timing info; overrides verbose<BR>
    <I>-v</I> print diagnostic output to screen<BR>
    <I>-a</I> use async_node version<BR>
    <I>filename</I> name of the file to compress<BR>


<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Parallel Inspector:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the example
    (see the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>build directions</A>).
    <BR>Run it with a small problem size, e.g., <TT>fgbzip2 -b=1 -a fgbzip2</TT>.
