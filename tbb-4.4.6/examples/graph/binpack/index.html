<H2>Overview</H2>

This directory contains a simple tbb::flow example that performs 
binpacking of N integer values into a near-optimal number of bins
of capacity V. It features a source_node which passes randomly
generated integer values of size<=V to a queue_node.  Multiple
function_nodes set about taking values from this queue_node and 
packing them into bins according to a best-fit policy.  Items that
cannot be made to fit are rejected and returned to the queue. When 
a bin is packed as well as it can be, it is passed to a buffer_node
where it waits to be picked up by another function_node.  This final
function nodes gathers stats about the bin and optionally prints its
contents.  When all bins are accounted for, it optionally prints a 
summary of the quality of the bin-packing.

<H2>Usage</H2>
<DL>

<DT><TT>binpack <I>-h</I></TT>
<DD>Prints the help for command line options
<DT><TT>binpack [<I>#threads</I>=value] [<I>verbose</I>] [<I>silent</I>] [<I>N</I>=value] [<I>V</I>=value] [<I>#packers</I>=value] [<I>optimality</I>=value] [<I>#threads</I>]</TT>
<DD><I>#threads</I> is the number of threads to use; a range of the form <I>low</I>[:<I>high</I>] where low and optional high are non-negative integers, or 'auto' for the TBB default.<BR>
    <I>verbose</I> print diagnostic output to screen<BR>
    <I>silent</I> limits output to timing info; overrides verbose<BR>
    <I>N</I> number of values to pack<BR>
    <I>V</I> capacity of each bin<BR>
    <I>#packers</I> number of concurrent bin packers to use (default=#threads)<BR>
    <I>optimality</I> controls optimality of solution; 1 is highest, use larger numbers for less optimal but faster solution<BR>


<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Parallel Inspector:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the example
    (see the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>build directions</A>).
    <BR>Run it with a small problem size and the desired number of threads, e.g., <TT>binpack 4 N=100</TT>.
