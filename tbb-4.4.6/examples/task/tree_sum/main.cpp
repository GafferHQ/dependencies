// The performance of this example can be significantly better when
// the objects are allocated by the scalable_allocator instead of the
// default "operator new".  The reason is that the scalable_allocator
// typically packs small objects more tightly than the default "operator new",
// resulting in a smaller memory footprint, and thus more efficient use of
// cache and virtual memory.  Also the scalable_allocator works faster for
// multi-threaded allocations.
//
// Pass stdmalloc as the 1st command line parameter to use the default "operator new"
// and see the performance difference.
