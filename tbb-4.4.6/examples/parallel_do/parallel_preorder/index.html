<H2>Overview</H2>
Example that uses parallel_do to do parallel preorder traversal of a sparse graph.
<P>
Each vertex in the graph is called a "cell".  
Each cell has a value. 
The value is a matrix. 
Some of the cells have operators
that compute the cell's value, using other cell's values as input.
A cell that uses the value of cell x is called a successor of x.
</P><P>
The algorithm works as follows. 
<OL>
<LI> Compute the set of cells that have no inputs. This set is called <TT>root_set</TT>.
<LI> Each cell has an associated field <TT>ref_count</TT> that is an atomic integer.
     Initialize <TT>ref_count</TT> to the number of inputs for the Cell.
<LI> Update each cell in <TT>root_set</TT>, by applying a <TT>parallel_do</TT> to a <TT>root_set</TT>
<LI> After updating a cell, for each of its successors 
<OL>
<LI> Atomically decrement the successor's <TT>ref_count</TT>
<LI> If the count became zero, add the cell to the set of cells to be updated,
     by calling <TT>parallel_do_feeder_impl::add</TT>.
</OL>
</OL>
</P><P>
The times printed are for the traversal and update, 
and do not include time for computing the root_set.
</P><P>
The example is using custom synchronization via <TT>ref_count</TT> atomic variable.
Correctness checking tools might not take this into account, and report data races
between different tasks that are actually synchronized.
</P>

<B>NOTE: </B>It is important to understand that this example is unlikely to show speedup 
if the cell values are changed to type "float".  The reason is twofold.
<UL>
<LI> The smaller value type causes each Cell to be significantly smaller than a cache line,
     which leads to false sharing conflicts.
<LI> The time to update the cells becomes very small, and consequently the overhead of
     parallel_do swamps the useful work.
</UL>

<H2>Usage</H2>
<DL>
<DT><TT>parallel_preorder <I>-h</I></TT>
<DD>Prints the help for command line options
<DT><TT>parallel_preorder [<I>n-of-threads</I>=value] [<I>n-of-nodes</I>=value] [<I>n-of-traversals</I>=value] [<I>silent</I>] </TT>
<DT><TT>parallel_preorder [<I>n-of-threads</I> [<I>n-of-nodes</I> [<I>n-of-traversals</I>]]] [<I>silent</I>] </TT> 
<DD><I>n-of-threads</I> is the number of threads to use; a range of the form <I>low</I>[:<I>high</I>], where low and optional high are non-negative integers or 'auto' for the TBB default.<BR>
    <I>n-of-nodes</I> is a number of nodes in the graph. Default value is 1000.<BR>
    <I>n-of-traversals</I> is the number of times to evaluate the graph. Default value is 500.<BR>
    <I>silent</I> - no output except elapsed time.<BR>
<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Parallel Inspector:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the example
    (see the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>build directions</A>).
    <BR>Run it with the desired number of threads and smaller number of traversals, e.g., <TT>parallel_preorder 4 1000 5</TT>.
