/*!
    \class QSGGeometry

    \brief The QSGGeometry class provides low-level
    storage for graphics primitives in the \l{Qt Quick Scene Graph}.

    \inmodule QtQuick

    The QSGGeometry class stores the geometry of the primitives
    rendered with the scene graph. It contains vertex data and
    optionally index data. The mode used to draw the geometry is
    specified with setDrawingMode(), which maps directly to the OpenGL
    drawing mode, such as \c GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, \c GL_TRIANGLES, or
    \c GL_POINTS.

    Vertices can be as simple as points defined by x and y values or
    can be more complex where each vertex contains a normal, texture
    coordinates and a 3D position. The QSGGeometry::AttributeSet is
    used to describe how the vertex data is built up. The attribute
    set can only be specified on construction.  The QSGGeometry class
    provides a few convenience attributes and attribute sets by
    default. The defaultAttributes_Point2D() function returns an
    attribute set to be used in normal solid color rectangles, while
    the defaultAttributes_TexturedPoint2D function returns attributes
    to be used for textured 2D geometry. The vertex data is internally
    stored as a \c {void *} and is accessible with the vertexData()
    function. Convenience accessors for the common attribute sets are
    available with vertexDataAsPoint2D() and
    vertexDataAsTexturedPoint2D(). Vertex data is allocated by passing
    a vertex count to the constructor or by calling allocate() later.

    The QSGGeometry can optionally contain indices of either unsigned
    32-bit, unsigned 16-bit, or unsigned 8-bit integers. The index type
    must be specified during construction and cannot be changed.

    Below is a snippet illustrating how a geometry composed of
    position and color vertices can be built.

    \code
    struct MyPoint2D {
        float x;
        float y;
        float r;
        float g;
        float b;
        float a;

        void set(float x_, float y_, float r_, float g_, float b_, float a_) {
            x = x_;
            y = y_;
            r = r_;
            g = g_;
            b = b_;
            a = a_;
        }
    };

    QSGGeometry::Attribute MyPoint2D_Attributes[] = {
        QSGGeometry::Attribute::create(0, 2, GL_FLOAT, true),
        QSGGeometry::Attribute::create(1, 4, GL_FLOAT, false)
    };

    QSGGeometry::AttributeSet MyPoint2D_AttributeSet = {
        2,
        sizeof(MyPoint2D),
        MyPoint2D_Attributes
    };

    ...

    geometry = new QSGGeometry(MyPoint2D_AttributeSet, 2);
    geometry->setDrawingMode(GL_LINES);

    MyPoint2D *vertices = static_cast<MyPoint2D *>(geometry->vertexData());
    vertices[0].set(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1);
    vertices[1].set(width(), height(), 0, 0, 1, 1);
    \endcode

    The QSGGeometry is a software buffer and client-side in terms of
    OpenGL rendering, as the buffers used in 2D graphics typically consist of
    many small buffers that change every frame and do not benefit from
    being uploaded to graphics memory. However, the QSGGeometry
    supports hinting to the renderer that a buffer should be
    uploaded using the setVertexDataPattern() and
    setIndexDataPattern() functions. Whether this hint is respected or
    not is implementation specific.

    \sa QSGGeometryNode, {Scene Graph - Custom Geometry}

    rendering thread. See \l {Scene Graph and Rendering} for more information.
