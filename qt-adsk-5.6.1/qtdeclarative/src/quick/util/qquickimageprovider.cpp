/*!
    \class QQuickImageProvider
    \since 5.0
    \inmodule QtQuick
    \brief The QQuickImageProvider class provides an interface for supporting pixmaps and threaded image requests in QML.

    QQuickImageProvider is used to provide advanced image loading features
    in QML applications. It allows images in QML to be:

    \list
    \li Loaded using QPixmaps rather than actual image files
    \li Loaded asynchronously in a separate thread
    \endlist

    To specify that an image should be loaded by an image provider, use the
    \b {"image:"} scheme for the URL source of the image, followed by the
    identifiers of the image provider and the requested image. For example:

    \qml
    Image { source: "image://myimageprovider/image.png" }
    \endqml

    This specifies that the image should be loaded by the image provider named
    "myimageprovider", and the image to be loaded is named "image.png". The QML engine
    invokes the appropriate image provider according to the providers that have
    been registered through QQmlEngine::addImageProvider().

    Note that the identifiers are case-insensitive, but the rest of the URL will be passed on with
    preserved case. For example, the below snippet would still specify that the image is loaded by the
    image provider named "myimageprovider", but it would request a different image than the above snippet
    ("Image.png" instead of "image.png").
    \qml
    Image { source: "image://MyImageProvider/Image.png" }
    \endqml

    If you want the rest of the URL to be case insensitive, you will have to take care
    of that yourself inside your image provider.

    \section2 An example

    Here are two images. Their \c source values indicate they should be loaded by
    an image provider named "colors", and the images to be loaded are "yellow"
    and "red", respectively:

    \snippet imageprovider/imageprovider-example.qml 0

    When these images are loaded by QML, it looks for a matching image provider
    and calls its requestImage() or requestPixmap() method (depending on its
    imageType()) to load the image. The method is called with the \c id
    parameter set to "yellow" for the first image, and "red" for the second.

    Here is an image provider implementation that can load the images
    requested by the above QML. This implementation dynamically
    generates QPixmap images that are filled with the requested color:

    \snippet imageprovider/imageprovider.cpp 0
    \codeline
    \snippet imageprovider/imageprovider.cpp 1

    To make this provider accessible to QML, it is registered with the QML engine
    with a "colors" identifier:

    \code
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        ...

        QQuickView view;
        QQmlEngine *engine = view.engine();
        engine->addImageProvider(QLatin1String("colors"), new ColorPixmapProvider);

        ...
    }
    \endcode

    Now the images can be successfully loaded in QML:

    \image imageprovider.png

    See the \l {imageprovider}{Image Provider Example} for the complete implementation.
    Note that the example registers the provider via a \l{QQmlExtensionPlugin}{plugin}
    instead of registering it in the application \c main() function as shown above.


    \section2 Asynchronous image loading

    Image providers that support QImage or Texture loading automatically include support
    for asychronous loading of images. To enable asynchronous loading for an
    image source, set the \c asynchronous property to \c true for the relevant
    \l Image, \l BorderImage or \l AnimatedImage object. When this is enabled,
    the image request to the provider is run in a low priority thread,
    allowing image loading to be executed in the background, and reducing the
    performance impact on the user interface.

    To force asynchronous image loading, even for image sources that do not
    have the \c asynchronous property set to \c true, you may pass the
    \c QQmlImageProviderBase::ForceAsynchronousImageLoading flag to the image
    provider constructor. This ensures that all image requests for the
    provider are handled in a separate thread.

    Asynchronous loading for image providers that provide QPixmap is only supported
    in platforms that have the ThreadedPixmaps feature, in platforms where
    pixmaps can only be created in the main thread (i.e. ThreadedPixmaps is not supported)
    if \l {Image::}{asynchronous} is set to \c true, the value is ignored
    and the image is loaded synchronously.

    Asynchronous image loading for providers of type other than ImageResponse are
    executed on a single thread per engine basis. That means that a slow image provider
    will block the loading of any other request. To avoid that we suggest using QQuickAsyncImageProvider
    and implement threading on the provider side via a \c QThreadPool or similar.
    See the \l {imageresponseprovider}{Image Response Provider Example} for a complete implementation.


    \section2 Image caching

    Images returned by a QQuickImageProvider are automatically cached,
    similar to any image loaded by the QML engine. When an image with a
    "image://" prefix is loaded from cache, requestImage() and requestPixmap()
    will not be called for the relevant image provider. If an image should always
    be fetched from the image provider, and should not be cached at all, set the
    \c cache property to \c false for the relevant \l Image, \l BorderImage or
    \l AnimatedImage object.

    The \l {Qt Quick 1} version of this class is named QDeclarativeImageProvider.
