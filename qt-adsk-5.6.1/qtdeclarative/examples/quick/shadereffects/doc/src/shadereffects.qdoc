    \title Qt Quick Examples - Shader Effects
    \example shadereffects
    \image qml-shadereffects-example.png
    \brief A Qt Quick example demonstrating the use of shader effects.
    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    This example demonstrates a couple of visual effects that you can perform
    with shaders in Qt Quick. It applies five different effects on a text and
    a couple of images. For more information, visit
    \l{Important Concepts In Qt Quick - Graphical Effects}

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Using ShaderEffect

    The \l ShaderEffect type typically operates on other types, using a
    \l ShaderEffectSource:
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml source

    In the above snippet, \c theItem is the ID of a complex QML object in the
    file.

    ShaderEffects can use this ShaderEffectSource as a texture in their fragment
    shader:
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml fragment

    You can use any custom property on the ShaderEffect in your shader. This
    makes animated shader code very easy:
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml properties

    ShaderEffects can also have a custom vertext shader. Setting the mesh
    property on ShaderEffect provides more vertices for you to manipulate,
    enabling more effects.
