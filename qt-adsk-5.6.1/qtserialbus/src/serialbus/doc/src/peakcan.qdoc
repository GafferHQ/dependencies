    \title Using PeakCAN Backend

    \brief Overview of how to use the PeakCAN backend.

    The PeakCAN backend encapsulates the low-level API to work with the
    \l{http://www.peak-system.com/}{PCAN} adapters.

    \section1 Creating CAN Bus Devices

    At first it is necessary to check that QCanBus provides the desired backend:

    \code
        foreach (const QByteArray &backend, QCanBus::instance()->plugins()) {
            if (backend == "peakcan") {
                // were found
                break;
            }
        }
    \endcode

    Where, \e peakcan is the backend name.

    Further, it is necessary to request from QCanBus the device with the active PeakCan
    interface:

    \code
        QCanBusDevice *device = QCanBus::instance()->createDevice("peakcan", QStringLiteral("usbbus1"));
        device->connectDevice();
    \endcode

    Where, \e usbbus1 is the active CAN interface name. The PCAN API support eight USB
    interfaces from \e usbbus1 to \e usbbus8 and eight PCI interfaces from \e pcibus1 to
    \e pcibus8.

    \note Only the USB and PCI adapters are currently supported by this backend.

    The device is now open and can be written and read:

    \code
        QCanBusFrame frame;
        frame.setFrameId(8);
        QByteArray payload("A36E");
        frame.setPayload(payload);
        device->writeFrame(frame);
    \endcode

    The reading can be done using the \l {QCanBusDevice::}{readFrame()} method. The
    \l {QCanBusDevice::}{framesReceived()} signal is emitted when a new frame is available
    for reading:

    \code
    QCanBusFrame frame = device->readFrame();
    \endcode

    PeakCAN supports the following configurations that can be controlled through
    \l {QCanBusDevice::}{setConfigurationParameter()}:

    \table
        \header
            \li Configuration parameter key
            \li Description
        \row
            \li QDCanBusDevice::BitRateKey
            \li Determines the bit rate of the CAN bus connection. The following bit rates
                are supported: 5000, 10000, 20000, 33000, 47000, 50000, 83000, 95000,
                100000, 125000, 250000, 500000, 800000, 1000000. Note that this configuration
                parameter can only be adjusted while the QCanBusDevice is not connected.
