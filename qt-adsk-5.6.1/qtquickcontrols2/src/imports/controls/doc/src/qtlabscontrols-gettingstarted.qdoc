    \title Getting Started with Qt Labs Controls

    A basic example of a QML file that makes use of controls is shown here:

    \snippet basic-example.qml 0

    \section1 Setting Up Controls from C++

    Although QQuickView has traditionally been used to display QML files in a
    C++ application, doing this means you can only set window properties from
    C++.

    With Qt Labs Controls, declare an ApplicationWindow as the root item of
    your application and launch it by using QQmlApplicationEngine instead.
    This ensures that you can control top level window properties from QML.

    A basic example of a source file that makes use of controls is shown here:

    \code
    #include <QGuiApplication>
    #include <QQmlApplicationEngine>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        QGuiApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling);
        QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);
        QQmlApplicationEngine engine;
        engine.load(QUrl(QStringLiteral("qrc:/main.qml")));
        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    \section2 Using C++ Data From QML

    If you need to register a C++ class to use from QML, you can call
    qmlRegisterType() before declaring your QQmlApplicationEngine.
    See \l [QtQml] {Defining QML Types from C++} for more information.

    If you need to expose data to QML components, you need to make them
    available to the context of the current QML engine. See QQmlContext for
    more information.
