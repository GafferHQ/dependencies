    \title Default Style

    The Default style is a basic all-round style.

    The Default style a simple and light-weight style that offers the maximum
    performance for Qt Labs Controls. It is built with a minimal amount of Qt
    Quick primitives, and keeps animations and transitions to the minimum.

    \image qtlabscontrols-default.png

    The style is selected by default when running Qt Labs Controls applications.
    It is built into the module's resources, so by default it is shipped with
    any application that depends on the Qt Labs Controls module

    \note The Default style is used as a fallback for other styles. If a style
    does not implement a certain control, the Default style implementation of
    that control is selected.
