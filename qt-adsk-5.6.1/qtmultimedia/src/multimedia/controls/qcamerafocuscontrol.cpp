    \brief The QCameraFocusControl class supplies control for
    focusing related camera parameters.

    \inmodule QtMultimedia


    \ingroup multimedia_control

    The interface name of QCameraFocusControl is \c org.qt-project.qt.camerafocuscontrol/5.0 as
    defined in QCameraFocusControl_iid.
