    \brief The QMediaPlaylistSourceControl class provides access to the playlist playback
    functionality of a QMediaService.

    This control allows QMediaPlaylist to be passed directly to the service
    instead of playing media sources one by one.  This control should be
    implemented if backend benefits from knowing the next media source to be
    played, for example for preloading, cross fading or gap-less playback.

    If QMediaPlaylistSourceControl is provided, the backend must listen for
    current playlist item changes to load corresponding media source and
    advance the playlist  with QMediaPlaylist::next() when playback of the
    current media is finished.

    The interface name of QMediaPlaylistSourceControl is \c org.qt-project.qt.mediaplaylistsourcecontrol/5.0 as
    defined in QMediaPlaylistSourceControl_iid.
