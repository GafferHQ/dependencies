    \class QSound
    \brief The QSound class provides a method to play .wav sound files.
    \inmodule QtMultimedia
    \ingroup multimedia
    \ingroup multimedia_audio

    Qt provides the most commonly required audio operation in GUI
    applications: asynchronously playing a sound file. This is most
    easily accomplished using the static play() function:

    \snippet multimedia-snippets/qsound.cpp 0

    Alternatively, create a QSound object from the sound file first
    and then call the play() slot:

    \snippet multimedia-snippets/qsound.cpp 1

    Once created a QSound object can be queried for its fileName() and
    total number of loops() (i.e. the number of times the sound will
    play). The number of repetitions can be altered using the
    setLoops() function. While playing the sound, the loopsRemaining()
    function returns the remaining number of repetitions. Use the
    isFinished() function to determine whether the sound has finished
    playing.

    Sounds played using a QSound object may use more memory than the
    static play() function, but it may also play more immediately
    (depending on the underlying platform audio facilities).

    If you require finer control over playing sounds, consider the
    \l QSoundEffect or \l QAudioOutput classes.
