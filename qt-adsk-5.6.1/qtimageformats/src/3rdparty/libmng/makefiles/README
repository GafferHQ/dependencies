For conditions of distribution and use, see copyright notice in libmng.h
or the file LICENSE in the top-level directory of the source distribution.

This directory hosts the makefiles for a number of supported platforms.

If you're using a system with POSIX shell capabilities, you can use the
'configure' script in the top-level directory, or generate it by running
'autogen.sh' if you have the necessary tools installed.

Otherwise, copy the module for your environment (or the closest thing)
into the libmng source-directory and change it to your needs. If you
create a new file for a platform not on the list send it to me (gerard @
libmng.com) and I'll be happy to include it in the next release!
