Dear JasPer Users:

I am pleased to announce the availability of JasPer version 1.900.1.

This release fixes some build problems as well as
a multiply-defined symbol problem in jpc_qmfb.h.

The new JasPer release is available from the JasPer Project Home Page
(i.e., http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper) and the JPEG web site
(i.e., http://www.jpeg.org/software).

Regards,
Michael
