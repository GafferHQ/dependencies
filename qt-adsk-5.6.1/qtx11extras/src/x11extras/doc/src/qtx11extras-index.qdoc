    \brief A Qt module which provides tools for developing for the X11 platform.

    Qt X11 Extras enables the Qt programmer to write applications for the Linux/X11
    platform. Applications developed with Qt can also be deployed across several
    other desktop and embedded operating systems without having to rewrite the source
    code.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:
