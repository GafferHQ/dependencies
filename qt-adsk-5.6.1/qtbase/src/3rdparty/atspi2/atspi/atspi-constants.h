 !\mainpage AT-SPI Interfaces and Subinterfaces

  This is the main documentation page for the
  Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI).

  \section apps Applications and Interface Components
  Namespace Accessibility includes service APIs implemented by
  participating applications and their user interface components:\n\n
  Accessibility::Accessible\n
  Accessibility::Application\n
  Accessibility::Desktop\n
  Accessibility::Collecgtion\n
  Accessibility::Component\n
  Accessibility::Hypertext\n
  Accessibility::Image\n
  Accessibility::Selection\n
  Accessibility::Table\n
  Accessibility::Text\n
  Accessibility::EditableText\n
  Accessibility::Value

  \section types Enumerated Types
  Accessibility defines a number of key enumerated types, including:\n\n
  Accessibility::RelationType\n
  Accessibility::Role\n
  Accessibility::StateType\n
  Accessibility::Event\n
  Accessibility::EventDetails \n

  \section Registry
  Accessibility also includes Accessibility::Registry,
  which is the service used by assistive technologies and related
  AT-SPI clients to register interest in certain classes of events,
  enumerate the currently available desktop and application list,
  and to synthesize certain kinds of device events.

  \section listeners Event Listener Interfaces
  Accessibility::EventListener\n
  Accessibility::DeviceEventListener

  \section helpers Helper Interfaces

  The following interfaces may be implemented by assistive technologies
  themselves, in order to export their services in a consistent manner or
  in order to interoperate with other applications or desktop services.\n

  Accessibility::LoginHelper : Implemented by adaptive technologies which
  need to participate in user-authentication or login activities, and which
  therefore may need negotiation with authentication agents or processes.\n

  Accessibility::Selector [NEW]: Implemented by user agents or assistive
  technologies which export lists of choices from which the end-user is
  expected to make selections.  Useful for various types of remote
  activation or intercommunication between multiple ATs.

 * 'foreground' widgets reside.
 * @ATSPI_LAYER_MDI: A special layer between @ATSPI_LAYER_CANVAS and

 * reside. See #atspi_component_get_mdi_z_order.

 * The #AtspiComponentLayer of an #AtspiComponent instance indicates its

 * region-of-interest for magnification, and in 
 * flat screen review models of the screen, as well as
 * for other uses. Objects residing in two of the #AtspiComponentLayer 
 * categories support further z-ordering information, with respect to their 
 * peers in the same layer: namely, @ATSPI_LAYER_WINDOW and 
 * @ATSPI_LAYER_MDI.  Relative stacking order for other objects within the 
 * same layer is not available; the recommended heuristic is 
 * first child paints first. In other words, assume that the 
 * first siblings in the child list are subject to being overpainted by later 
 * siblings if their bounds intersect. The order of layers, from bottom to top,
 *  is: @ATSPI_LAYER_BACKGROUND, @ATSPI_LAYER_WINDOW, @ATSPI_LAYER_MDI,

 * of text instead of grammatical sentences.
 * @ATSPI_TEXT_BOUNDARY_SENTENCE_END: Boundary condition is end of a sentence,

/**
 * AtspiStateType:
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INVALID: Indicates an invalid state - probably an error 
 * condition.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_ACTIVE: Indicates a window is currently the active window, or
 * is an active subelement within a container or table.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_ARMED: Indicates that the object is armed.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_BUSY: Indicates the current object is busy, i.e. onscreen
 * representation is in the process of changing, or       the object is
 * temporarily unavailable for interaction due to activity already in progress.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_CHECKED: Indicates this object is currently checked.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_COLLAPSED: Indicates this object is collapsed.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_DEFUNCT: Indicates that this object no longer has a valid
 * backing widget        (for instance, if its peer object has been destroyed).
 * @ATSPI_STATE_EDITABLE: Indicates the user can change the contents of this
 * object.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED: Indicates that this object is enabled, i.e. that it
 * currently reflects some application state. Objects that are "greyed out"
 * may lack this state, and may lack the @ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE if direct
 * user interaction cannot cause them to acquire @ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED. 
 * See @ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_EXPANDABLE: Indicates this object allows progressive
 * disclosure of its children.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_EXPANDED: Indicates this object is expanded.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_FOCUSABLE: Indicates this object can accept keyboard focus,
 * which means all       events resulting from typing on the keyboard will
 * normally be passed       to it when it has focus.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_FOCUSED: Indicates this object currently has the keyboard
 * focus.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_HAS_TOOLTIP: Indicates that the object has an associated
 * tooltip.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_HORIZONTAL: Indicates the orientation of this object is
 * horizontal.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_ICONIFIED: Indicates this object is minimized and is
 * represented only by an icon.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MODAL: Indicates something must be done with this object
 * before the user can interact with an object in a different window.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MULTI_LINE: Indicates this (text) object can contain multiple
 * lines of text.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MULTISELECTABLE: Indicates this object allows more than one of
 * its children to be selected at the same time, or in the case of text
 * objects, that the object supports non-contiguous text selections.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_OPAQUE: Indicates this object paints every pixel within its
 * rectangular region. It also indicates an alpha value of unity, if it
 * supports alpha blending.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_PRESSED: Indicates this object is currently pressed.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_RESIZABLE: Indicates the size of this object's size is not
 * fixed.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE: Indicates this object is the child of an object
 * that allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of
 * those children       that can be selected.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SELECTED: Indicates this object is the child of an object that
 * allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of those
 * children that has been selected.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE: Indicates this object is sensitive, e.g. to user
 * interaction. @ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE usually accompanies.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED for user-actionable controls, but may be found in the 
 * absence of @ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED if the current visible state of the control 
 * is "disconnected" from the application state.  In such cases, direct user
 * interaction can often result in the object gaining @ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE, 
 * for instance if a user makes an explicit selection using an object whose
 * current state is ambiguous or undefined. See @ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED,
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SHOWING: Indicates this object, the object's parent, the
 * object's parent's parent, and so on, are all 'shown' to the end-user,
 * i.e. subject to "exposure" if blocking or obscuring objects do not
 * interpose between this object and the top of the window stack.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SINGLE_LINE: Indicates this (text) object can contain only a
 * single line of text.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_STALE: Indicates that the information returned for this object
 * may no longer be synchronized with the application state.  This can occur
 * if the object has @ATSPI_STATE_TRANSIENT, and can also occur towards the 
 * end of the object peer's lifecycle.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_TRANSIENT: Indicates this object is transient.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VERTICAL: Indicates the orientation of this object is vertical;
 * for example this state may appear on such objects as scrollbars, text
 * objects (with vertical text flow), separators, etc.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE: Indicates this object is visible, e.g. has been
 * explicitly marked for exposure to the user. @ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE is no 
 * guarantee that the object is actually unobscured on the screen, only that 
 * it is 'potentially' visible, barring obstruction, being scrolled or clipped 
 * out of the field of view, or having an ancestor container that has not yet 
 * made visible. A widget is potentially onscreen if it has both 
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE and @ATSPI_STATE_SHOWING. The absence of 
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE and @ATSPI_STATE_SHOWING is
 * semantically equivalent to saying that an object is 'hidden'.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS: Indicates that "active-descendant-changed"
 * event is sent when children become 'active' (i.e. are selected or
 * navigated to onscreen).  Used to prevent need to enumerate all children
 * in very large containers, like tables. The presence of
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS is an indication to the client that the
 * children should not, and need not, be enumerated by the client.
 * Objects implementing this state are expected to provide relevant state      
 * notifications to listening clients, for instance notifications of 
 * visibility changes and activation of their contained child objects, without 
 * the client having previously requested references to those children.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE: Indicates that a check box or other boolean
 * indicator is in a state other than checked or not checked.  This
 * usually means that the boolean value reflected or controlled by the
 * object does not apply consistently to the entire current context.      
 * For example, a checkbox for the "Bold" attribute of text may have
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE if the currently selected text contains a mixture
 * of weight attributes. In many cases interacting with a
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE object will cause the context's corresponding
 * boolean attribute to be homogenized, whereupon the object will lose
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE and a corresponding state-changed event will be
 * fired.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_REQUIRED: Indicates that user interaction with this object is
 * 'required' from the user, for instance before completing the
 * processing of a form.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_TRUNCATED: 	  Indicates that an object's onscreen content
 * is truncated, e.g. a text value in a spreadsheet cell.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_ANIMATED: Indicates this object's visual representation is
 * dynamic, not static. This state may be applied to an object during an
 * animated 'effect' and be removed from the object once its visual
 * representation becomes static. Some applications, notably content viewers,
 * may not be able to detect all kinds of animated content.  Therefore the
 * absence of this state should not be taken as
 * definitive evidence that the object's visual representation is      
 * static; this state is advisory.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INVALID_ENTRY: This object has indicated an error condition
 * due to failure of input validation.  For instance, a form control may
 * acquire this state in response to invalid or malformed user input.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SUPPORTS_AUTOCOMPLETION: This state indicates that the object
 * in question implements some form of typeahead or       
 * pre-selection behavior whereby entering the first character of one or more
 * sub-elements causes those elements to scroll into view or become
 * selected. Subsequent character input may narrow the selection further as
 * long as one or more sub-elements match the string. This state is normally
 * only useful and encountered on objects that implement #AtspiSelection.
 * In some cases the typeahead behavior may result in full or partial
 * completion of the data in the input field, in which case
 * these input events may trigger text-changed events from the source.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE_TEXT: This state indicates that the object in
 * question supports text selection. It should only be exposed on objects
 * which implement the #AtspiText interface, in order to distinguish this state
 * from @ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE, which infers that the object in question is a
 * selectable child of an object which implements #AtspiSelection. While 
 * similar, text selection and subelement selection are distinct operations.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_IS_DEFAULT: This state indicates that the object in question is
 * the 'default' interaction object in a dialog, i.e. the one that gets
 * activated if the user presses "Enter" when the dialog is initially
 * posted.
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VISITED: This state indicates that the object (typically a
 * hyperlink) has already been activated or invoked, with the result that
 * some backing data has been downloaded or rendered.
 *@ATSPI_STATE_CHECKABLE: Indicates this object has the potential to
 *  be checked, such as a checkbox or toggle-able table cell. @Since:
 *  2.12
 *@ATSPI_STATE_HAS_POPUP: Indicates that the object has a popup
 * context menu or sub-level menu which may or may not be
 * showing. This means that activation renders conditional content.
 * Note that ordinary tooltips are not considered popups in this
 * context. @Since: 2.12
 * @ATSPI_STATE_LAST_DEFINED: This value of the enumeration should not be used
 * as a parameter, it indicates the number of items in the #AtspiStateType
 * enumeration.
 *
 * 
 * Enumeration used by various interfaces indicating every possible state 
 * an #AtspiAccesible object can assume.

 * denote content rendered by embedded renderers that live in a separate process
 * space from the embedding context.
 * @ATSPI_RELATION_POPUP_FOR: Denotes that the object is a transient window or
 * frame associated with another onscreen object. Similar to @ATSPI_TOOLTIP_FOR,
 * but more general. Useful for windows which are technically toplevels
 * but which, for one or more reasons, do not explicitly cause their 
 * associated window to lose 'window focus'. Creation of an @ATSPI_ROLE_WINDOW
 * object with the @ATSPI_RELATION_POPUP_FOR relation usually requires 
 * some presentation action on the part
 * of assistive technology clients, even though the previous toplevel
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_FRAME object may still be the active window.
 * @ATSPI_RELATION_PARENT_WINDOW_OF: This is the reciprocal relation to

 * textual, about another user interface element such as a table, chart, or
 * image.

 * ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME:  Either this object, or a singleton descendant, 
 * should implement the #AtspiDocument interface.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_HEADING: The object serves as a heading for content which
 * follows it in a document. The 'heading level' of the heading, if
 * availabe,  may be obtained by       querying the object's attributes.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_PAGE: The object is a containing instance which encapsulates a
 * page of information. @ATSPI_ROLE_PAGE is used in documents and content which
 * support a paginated navigation model.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_SECTION: The object is a containing instance of document content
 * which constitutes a particular 'logical' section of the document.  The
 * type of content within a section, and the nature of the section division
 * itself, may be obtained by querying the object's attributes.  Sections
 * may be nested.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_REDUNDANT_OBJECT: The object is redundant with another object in
 * the hierarchy, and is exposed for purely technical reasons.  Objects of
 * this role should be ignored by clients, if they are encountered at all.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_FORM: The object is a containing instance of document content
 * which has within it components with which the user can interact in order
 * to input information; i.e. the object is a container for pushbuttons,    
 * comboboxes, text input fields, and other 'GUI' components. @ATSPI_ROLE_FORM
 * should not, in general, be used for toplevel GUI containers or dialogs,
 * but should be reserved for 'GUI' containers which occur within document
 * content, for instance within Web documents, presentations, or text
 * documents.  Unlike other GUI containers and dialogs which occur inside      
 * application instances, @ATSPI_ROLE_FORM containers' components are
 * associated with the current document, rather than the current foreground 
 * application or viewer instance.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_LINK: The object is a hypertext anchor, i.e. a "link" in a      
 * hypertext document.  Such objects are distinct from 'inline'       content
 * which may also use the #AtspiHypertext/#AtspiHyperlink interfacesto indicate
 * the range/location within a text object where an inline or embedded object
 * lies.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_INPUT_METHOD_WINDOW: The object is a window or similar viewport
 * which is used to allow composition or input of a 'complex character',    
 * in other words it is an "input method window".
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_TABLE_ROW: A row in a table.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_TREE_ITEM: An object that represents an element of a tree.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_SPREADSHEET: A document frame which contains a
 * spreadsheet.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_PRESENTATION: A document frame which contains a
 * presentation or slide content.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_TEXT: A document frame which contains textual content,
 * such as found in a word processing
 * application.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_WEB: A document frame which contains HTML or other
 * markup suitable for display in a web browser.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_EMAIL: A document frame which contains email content
 * to be displayed or composed either in plain text or
 * HTML.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_COMMENT: An object found within a document and designed to
 * present a comment, note, or other annotation. In some cases, this object
 * might not be visible until activated.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_LIST_BOX: A non-collapsible list of choices the user can
 * select from.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_GROUPING: A group of related widgets. This group typically has
 * a label.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_IMAGE_MAP: An image map object. Usually a graphic with multiple
 * hotspots, where each hotspot can be activated resulting in the loading of
 * another document or section of a document.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_NOTIFICATION: A transitory object designed to present a
 * message to the user, typically at the desktop level rather than inside a
 * particular application.
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_INFO_BAR: An object designed to present a message to the user
 * within an existing window.
 *@ATSPI_ROLE_LEVEL_BAR: A bar that serves as a level indicator to, for

 * composition that forms an independent part of a document, page, or
 * site. Examples: A blog entry, a news story, a forum post. @Since:
 * 2.12
 *@ATSPI_ROLE_LANDMARK: A region of a web page intended as a
 * navigational landmark. This is designed to allow Assistive
 * Technologies to provide quick navigation among key regions within a
 * document. @Since: 2.12
 *@ATSPI_ROLE_LOG: A text widget or container holding log content, such
 * as chat history and error logs. In this role there is a
 * relationship between the arrival of new items in the log and the
 * reading order. The log contains a meaningful sequence and new
 * information is added only to the end of the log, not at arbitrary
 * points. @Since: 2.12
 *@ATSPI_ROLE_MARQUEE: A container where non-essential information
 * changes frequently. Common usages of marquee include stock tickers
 * and ad banners. The primary difference between a marquee and a log
 * is that logs usually have a meaningful order or sequence of
 * important content changes. @Since: 2.12
 *@ATSPI_ROLE_MATH: A text widget or container that holds a mathematical
 * expression. @Since: 2.12
 *@ATSPI_ROLE_RATING: A widget whose purpose is to display a rating,
 * such as the number of stars associated with a song in a media
 * player. Objects of this role should also implement
 * AtspiValue. @Since: 2.12
 *@ATSPI_ROLE_TIMER: An object containing a numerical counter which
 * indicates an amount of elapsed time from a start point, or the time
 * remaining until an end point. @Since: 2.12
