    \class QListIterator
    \inmodule QtCore

    \brief The QListIterator class provides a Java-style const iterator for QList and QQueue.

    QList has both \l{Java-style iterators} and \l{STL-style
    iterators}. The Java-style iterators are more high-level and
    easier to use than the STL-style iterators; on the other hand,
    they are slightly less efficient.

    An alternative to using iterators is to use index positions. Most
    QList member functions take an index as their first parameter,
    making it possible to access, modify, and remove items without
    using iterators.

    QListIterator\<T\> allows you to iterate over a QList\<T\> (or a
    QQueue\<T\>). If you want to modify the list as you iterate over
    it, use QMutableListIterator\<T\> instead.

    The QListIterator constructor takes a QList as argument. After
    construction, the iterator is located at the very beginning of
    the list (before the first item). Here's how to iterate over all
    the elements sequentially:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qiterator.cpp 0

    The next() function returns the next item in the list and
    advances the iterator. Unlike STL-style iterators, Java-style
    iterators point \e between items rather than directly \e at
    items. The first call to next() advances the iterator to the
    position between the first and second item, and returns the first
    item; the second call to next() advances the iterator to the
    position between the second and third item, and returns the second
    item; and so on.

    \image javaiterators1.png

    Here's how to iterate over the elements in reverse order:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qiterator.cpp 1

    If you want to find all occurrences of a particular value, use
    findNext() or findPrevious() in a loop.

    Multiple iterators can be used on the same list. If the list is
    modified while a QListIterator is active, the QListIterator will
    continue iterating over the original list, ignoring the modified
    copy.

    \brief The QMapIterator class provides a Java-style const iterator for QMap and QMultiMap.

    QMap has both \l{Java-style iterators} and \l{STL-style
    iterators}. The Java-style iterators are more high-level and
    easier to use than the STL-style iterators; on the other hand,
    they are slightly less efficient.

    QMapIterator\<Key, T\> allows you to iterate over a QMap (or a
    QMultiMap). If you want to modify the map as you iterate over
    it, use QMutableMapIterator instead.

    The QMapIterator constructor takes a QMap as argument. After
    construction, the iterator is located at the very beginning of
    the map (before the first item). Here's how to iterate over all
    the elements sequentially:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qiterator.cpp 26

    The next() function returns the next item in the map and
    advances the iterator. The key() and value() functions return the
    key and value of the last item that was jumped over.

    Unlike STL-style iterators, Java-style iterators point \e between
    items rather than directly \e at items. The first call to next()
    advances the iterator to the position between the first and
    second item, and returns the first item; the second call to
    next() advances the iterator to the position between the second
    and third item; and so on.

    \image javaiterators1.png

    Here's how to iterate over the elements in reverse order:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qiterator.cpp 27

    If you want to find all occurrences of a particular value, use
    findNext() or findPrevious() in a loop. For example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qiterator.cpp 28

    Multiple iterators can be used on the same map. If the map is
    modified while a QMapIterator is active, the QMapIterator will
    continue iterating over the original map, ignoring the modified
    copy.
