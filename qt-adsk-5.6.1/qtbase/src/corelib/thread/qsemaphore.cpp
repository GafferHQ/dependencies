    \class QSemaphore
    \inmodule QtCore
    \brief The QSemaphore class provides a general counting semaphore.

    \threadsafe

    \ingroup thread

    A semaphore is a generalization of a mutex. While a mutex can
    only be locked once, it's possible to acquire a semaphore
    multiple times. Semaphores are typically used to protect a
    certain number of identical resources.

    Semaphores support two fundamental operations, acquire() and
    release():

    \list
    \li acquire(\e{n}) tries to acquire \e n resources. If there aren't
       that many resources available, the call will block until this
       is the case.
    \li release(\e{n}) releases \e n resources.
    \endlist

    There's also a tryAcquire() function that returns immediately if
    it cannot acquire the resources, and an available() function that
    returns the number of available resources at any time.

    Example:

    \snippet code/src_corelib_thread_qsemaphore.cpp 0

    A typical application of semaphores is for controlling access to
    a circular buffer shared by a producer thread and a consumer
    thread. The \l{Semaphores Example} shows how
    to use QSemaphore to solve that problem.

    A non-computing example of a semaphore would be dining at a
    restaurant. A semaphore is initialized with the number of chairs
    in the restaurant. As people arrive, they want a seat. As seats
    are filled, available() is decremented. As people leave, the
    available() is incremented, allowing more people to enter. If a
    party of 10 people want to be seated, but there are only 9 seats,
    those 10 people will wait, but a party of 4 people would be
    seated (taking the available seats to 5, making the party of 10
    people wait longer).

    Tries to acquire \c n resources guarded by the semaphore and

    available.

    Note: Passing a negative number as the \a timeout is equivalent to
    calling acquire(), i.e. this function will wait forever for
    resources to become available if \a timeout is negative.
