/*
 * QBasicMutex implementation on Linux with futexes
 *
 * QBasicMutex contains one pointer value, which can contain one of four
 * different values:
 *    0x0       unlocked, non-recursive mutex
 *    0x1       locked non-recursive mutex, no waiters
 *    0x3       locked non-recursive mutex, at least one waiter
 *   > 0x3      recursive mutex, points to a QMutexPrivate object
 *
 * LOCKING (non-recursive):
 *
 * A non-recursive mutex starts in the 0x0 state, indicating that it's
 * unlocked. When the first thread attempts to lock it, it will perform a
 * testAndSetAcquire from 0x0 to 0x1. If that succeeds, the caller concludes
 * that it successfully locked the mutex. That happens in fastTryLock().
 *
 * If that testAndSetAcquire fails, QBasicMutex::lockInternal is called.
 *
 * lockInternal will examine the value of the pointer. Otherwise, it will use
 * futexes to sleep and wait for another thread to unlock. To do that, it needs
 * to set a pointer value of 0x3, which indicates that thread is waiting. It
 * does that by a simple fetchAndStoreAcquire operation.
 *
 * If the pointer value was 0x0, it means we succeeded in acquiring the mutex.
 * For other values, it will then call FUTEX_WAIT and with an expected value of
 * 0x3.
 *
 * If the pointer value changed before futex(2) managed to sleep, it will
 * return -1 / EWOULDBLOCK, in which case we have to start over. And even if we
 * are woken up directly by a FUTEX_WAKE, we need to acquire the mutex, so we
 * start over again.
 *
 * UNLOCKING (non-recursive):
 *
 * To unlock, we need to set a value of 0x0 to indicate it's unlocked. The
 * first attempt is a testAndSetRelease operation from 0x1 to 0x0. If that
 * succeeds, we're done.
 *
 * If it fails, unlockInternal() is called. The only possibility is that the
 * mutex value was 0x3, which indicates some other thread is waiting or was
 * waiting in the past. We then set the mutex to 0x0 and perform a FUTEX_WAKE.
