    \class QSqlDriverPlugin
    \brief The QSqlDriverPlugin class provides an abstract base for custom QSqlDriver plugins.

    \ingroup plugins
    \inmodule QtSql

    The SQL driver plugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it
    easy to create your own SQL driver plugins that can be loaded
    dynamically by Qt.

    Writing a SQL plugin is achieved by subclassing this base class,
    reimplementing the pure virtual function create(), and
    exporting the class with the Q_PLUGIN_METADATA() macro. See the SQL
    plugins that come with Qt for example implementations (in the
    \c{plugins/src/sqldrivers} subdirectory of the source
    distribution).

    The json file containing the metadata for the plugin contains a list of
    keys indicating the supported sql drivers

    \code
    { "Keys": [ "mysqldriver" ] }
    \endcode

/*!
    \fn QSqlDriver *QSqlDriverPlugin::create(const QString& key)

    Creates and returns a QSqlDriver object for the driver called \a
    key. The driver key is usually the class name of the required
    driver. Keys are case sensitive.

    Destroys the SQL driver plugin.

    You never have to call this explicitly. Qt destroys a plugin
    automatically when it is no longer used.
