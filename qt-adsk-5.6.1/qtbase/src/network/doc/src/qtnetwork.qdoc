    \title Qt Network
    \brief Provides networking capabilities

    Qt Network provides a set of APIs for programming applications that use
    TCP/IP. Operations such as requests, cookies, and sending data over HTTP
    are handled by various C++ classes.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To use Qt Network classes,add this directive into the C++ files:
    \code
    #include <QtNetwork>
    \endcode
    To link against the Qt Network module, add this line to the project file:
    \code
    QT += network
    \endcode

    \section1 Articles and Guides

    These articles contain information about Qt Network setup and about
    applications with networking capabilities.
