This is the example to demonstrate the server buffer interfaces

Compile up both compositor and client.

If you have the drm-egl-server buffer integration (and your running Mesa)
then start the compositor with:

# QT_WAYLAND_SERVER_BUFFER_INTEGRATION=drm-egl-server ./compositor

The compositor is using the hardware integration extension to boradcast
to all clients to use the same server buffer integration, so all you need
to do is to start the client with

# ./client -platform wayland

You should then see a red box in top left corner, with a black cross and
a horisontal line in the top half (centered).
