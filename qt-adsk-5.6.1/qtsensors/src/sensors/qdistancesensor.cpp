    \brief The QDistanceReading class holds distance reading in cm from the proximity sensor.

    The QDistanceReading class holds distance reading in cm from the proximity sensor.
    Note: Some proximity sensor only support two values for distance, a near and far value.
    In this case, the sensor should report its maximum range value to represent the far state,
    and a lesser value to represent the near state.

    \section2 QDistanceReading Units
    The distance is measured in cm

    The distance sensor is typically located in the front face of a device, and thus will
    measure the distance of an object from the device's front face.
