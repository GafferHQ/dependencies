    \title Porting from Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine
    \brief Overview of the differences between the Qt WebKit and Qt WebEngine API.

    The following sections contain information about porting an application that uses the
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.3/qtwebkit-index.html}{Qt WebKit}
    \l{http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.3/qml-qtwebkit-webview.html}{QWebView API} to use the
    \l{Qt WebEngine} QWebEngineView.

    \section1 Class Names

    The Qt WebEngine equivalent of Qt WebKit C++ classes are prefixed by
    "\e QWebEngine" instead of "\e QWeb".

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        #include <QWebHistory>
        #include <QWebHistoryItem>
        #include <QWebPage>
        #include <QWebView>

        QWebHistory
        QWebHistoryItem
        QWebPage
        QWebView
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine}
    \code
        #include <QWebEngineHistory>
        #include <QWebEngineHistoryItem>
        #include <QWebEnginePage>
        #include <QWebEngineView>

        QWebEngineHistory
        QWebEngineHistoryItem
        QWebEnginePage
        QWebEngineView
    \endcode


    \section1 Qt Module Name

    \section2 In qmake Project Files

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        QT += webkitwidgets
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine}
    \code
        QT += webenginewidgets
    \endcode

    \section2 Including the Module in Source Files

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        #include <QtWebKit/QtWebKit>
        #include <QtWebKitWidgets/QtWebKitWidgets> // With Qt >= 4.8
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine}
    \code
        #include <QtWebEngineWidgets/QtWebEngineWidgets>
    \endcode


    \section1 QWebFrame Has Been Merged into QWebEnginePage

    HTML frames can be used to divide web pages into several areas where the content can be
    represented individually.

    In Qt WebKit, QWebFrame represents a frame inside a web page. Each QWebPage object contains at
    least one frame, the main frame, obtained using QWebPage::mainFrame(). Additional frames will
    be created for the HTML \c <frame> element, which defines the appearance and contents of a
    single frame, or the \c <iframe> element, which inserts a frame within a block of text.

    In Qt WebEngine, frame handling has been merged into the QWebEnginePage class. All child frames
    are now considered part of the content, and only accessible through JavaScript. Methods of the
    QWebFrame class, such as \c load() are now available directly through the QWebEnginePage itself.

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        QWebPage page;
        connect(page.mainFrame(), SIGNAL(urlChanged(const QUrl&)), SLOT(mySlotName()));
        page.mainFrame()->load(url);
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine}
    \code
        QWebEnginePage page;
        connect(&page, SIGNAL(urlChanged(const QUrl&)), SLOT(mySlotName()));
        page.load(url);
    \endcode


    \section1 Some Methods Now Return Their Result Asynchronously

    Because Qt WebEngine uses a multi-process architecture, calls to some methods from applications
    will return immediately, while the results should be received asynchronously via a callback
    mechanism. A function pointer, a functor, or a lambda expression must be provided to handle the
    results when they become available.

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        QWebPage *page = new QWebPage;
        QTextEdit *textEdit = new QTextEdit;
        // *textEdit is modified immediately.
        textEdit->setPlainText(page->toHtml());
        textEdit->setPlainText(page->toPlainText());
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine (with a lambda function in C++11)}
    \code
        QWebEnginePage *page = new QWebEnginePage;
        QTextEdit *textEdit = new QTextEdit;
        // *textEdit must remain valid until the lambda function is called.
        page->toHtml([textEdit](const QString &result){ textEdit->setPlainText(result); });
        page->toPlainText([textEdit](const QString &result){ textEdit->setPlainText(result); });
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine (with a functor template wrapping a member function)}
    \code
        template<typename Arg, typename R, typename C>
        struct InvokeWrapper {
            R *receiver;
            void (C::*memberFun)(Arg);
            void operator()(Arg result) {
                (receiver->*memberFun)(result);
            }
        };

        template<typename Arg, typename R, typename C>
        InvokeWrapper<Arg, R, C> invoke(R *receiver, void (C::*memberFun)(Arg))
        {
            InvokeWrapper<Arg, R, C> wrapper = {receiver, memberFun};
            return wrapper;
        }

        QWebEnginePage *page = new QWebEnginePage;
        QTextEdit *textEdit = new QTextEdit;
        // *textEdit must remain valid until the functor is called.
        page->toHtml(invoke(textEdit, &QTextEdit::setPlainText));
        page->toPlainText(invoke(textEdit, &QTextEdit::setPlainText));
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine (with a regular functor)}
    \code
        struct SetPlainTextFunctor {
            QTextEdit *textEdit;
            SetPlainTextFunctor(QTextEdit *textEdit) : textEdit(textEdit) { }
            void operator()(const QString &result) {
                textEdit->setPlainText(result);
            }
        };

        QWebEnginePage *page = new QWebEnginePage;
        QTextEdit *textEdit = new QTextEdit;
        // *textEdit must remain valid until the functor is called.
        page->toHtml(SetPlainTextFunctor(textEdit));
        page->toPlainText(SetPlainTextFunctor(textEdit));
    \endcode


    \section1 Qt WebEngine Does Not Interact with QNetworkAccessManager

    Some classes of Qt Network such as QAuthenticator were reused for their interface
    but, unlike Qt WebKit, Qt WebEngine has its own HTTP implementation and cannot
    go through a QNetworkAccessManager.

    The signals and methods of QNetworkAccessManager that are still supported were
    moved to the QWebEnginePage class.

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        QNetworkAccessManager qnam;
        QWebPage page;
        page.setNetworkAccessManager(&qnam);
        connect(&qnam, SIGNAL(authenticationRequired(QNetworkReply*,QAuthenticator*)), this, SLOT(authenticate(QNetworkReply*,QAuthenticator*)));
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine}
    \code
        QWebEnginePage page;
        connect(&page, SIGNAL(authenticationRequired(QNetworkReply*,QAuthenticator*)), this, SLOT(authenticate(QNetworkReply*,QAuthenticator*)));
    \endcode

    This also affects the way in which certificates are managed. For more information, see
    \l {Managing Certificates}.

    \section1 Notes About Individual Methods

    \section2 evaluateJavaScript

    QWebFrame::evaluateJavaScript was moved and renamed as QWebEnginePage::runJavaScript.
    It is currently only possible to run JavaScript on the main frame of a page and the
    result is returned asynchronously to the provided functor.

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        QWebPage *page = new QWebPage;
        qDebug() << page->mainFrame()->evaluateJavaScript("'Java' + 'Script'");
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine (with lambda expressions in C++11)}
    \code
        QWebEnginePage *page = new QWebEnginePage;
        page->runJavaScript("'Java' + 'Script'", [](const QVariant &result){ qDebug() << result; });
    \endcode

    \section2 setHtml and setContent

    QWebEnginePage::setHtml and QWebEnginePage::setContent perform asynchronously
    the same way as a normal HTTP load would, unlike their QWebPage counterparts.

    \section2 setContentEditable

    QWebPage::setContentEditable has no equivalent since any document element can be made editable through
    the contentEditable attribute in the latest HTML standard. Therefore, QWebEnginePage::runJavaScript
    is all that is needed.

    \b {Qt WebKit}
    \code
        QWebPage page;
        page.setContentEditable(true);
    \endcode
    \b {Qt WebEngine}
    \code
        QWebEnginePage page;
        page.runJavascript("document.documentElement.contentEditable = true");
    \endcode


    \section1 Unavailable Qt WebKit API

    The Qt WebKit classes and methods in this list will not be available in Qt WebEngine.

    \table
    \row
        \li QGraphicsWebView
        \li Qt WebEngine is designed for being used with hardware acceleration. Because we could not
            support a web view class in a QGraphicsView unless it would be attached to a QGLWidget
            viewport, this feature is out of scope.
    \row
        \li QWebElement
        \li Qt WebEngine uses a multi-process architecture and this means that
            any access to the internal structure of the page has to be done
            asynchronously, any query result must be returned through callbacks.
            The QWebElement API was designed for synchronous access and this
            would require a complete redesign.
    \row
        \li QWebDatabase
        \li The Web SQL Database feature that this API was wrapping in Qt WebKit
            was dropped from the HTML5 standard.
    \row
        \li QWebPluginDatabase, QWebPluginFactory, QWebPluginInfo, QWebPage::setPalette,
            QWebView::setRenderHints
        \li Qt WebEngine renders web pages using Skia and is not using QPainter
            or Qt for this purpose. The HTML5 standard also now offers much
            better alternatives that were not available when native controls
            plugins were introduced in Qt WebKit.
    \row
        \li QWebHistoryInterface
        \li Visited links are persisted automatically by Qt WebEngine.
    \row
        \li QWebPage::setContentEditable
        \li In the latest HTML standard, any document element can be made editable through the
            \c contentEditable attribute. So \c runJavaScript is all that is needed:
            \c{page->runJavascript("document.documentElement.contentEditable = true")}
    \row
        \li QWebPage::setLinkDelegationPolicy
        \li There is no way to connect a signal to run C++ code when a link is clicked. However,
            link clicks can be delegated to the Qt application instead of having the HTML handler
            engine process them by overloading the QWebEnginePage::acceptNavigationRequest()
            function. This is necessary when an HTML document is used as part of the user interface,
            and not to display external data, for example, when displaying a list of results.
