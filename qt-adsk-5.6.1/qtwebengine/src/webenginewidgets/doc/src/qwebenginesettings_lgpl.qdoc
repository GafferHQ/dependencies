    \class QWebEngineSettings
    \since 5.4
    \brief The QWebEngineSettings class provides an object to store the settings used
    by QWebEnginePage.

    \inmodule QtWebEngineWidgets

    Each QWebEnginePage object has its own QWebEngineSettings object, which configures the
    settings for that page. If a setting is not configured, then it is looked
    up in the global settings object, which can be accessed using
    globalSettings().

    QWebEngineSettings allows configuration of browser properties, such as font sizes and
    families, the location of a custom style sheet, and generic attributes, such as JavaScript
    support. Individual attributes are set using the setAttribute() function. The
    \l{QWebEngineSettings::WebAttribute}{WebAttribute} enum further describes each attribute.

    \sa QWebEnginePage::settings(), QWebEngineView::settings()
*/

/*!
    \enum QWebEngineSettings::FontFamily

    This enum describes the generic font families defined by CSS 2.
    For more information see the
    \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#generic-font-families}{CSS standard}.

    \value StandardFont
    \value FixedFont
    \value SerifFont
    \value SansSerifFont
    \value CursiveFont
    \value FantasyFont
*/

/*!
    \enum QWebEngineSettings::FontSize

    This enum describes the font sizes configurable through QWebEngineSettings:

    \value MinimumFontSize The hard minimum font size.
    \value MinimumLogicalFontSize The minimum logical font size that is applied
        when zooming out.
    \value DefaultFontSize The default font size for regular text.
    \value DefaultFixedFontSize The default font size for fixed-pitch text.

/*!
    \enum QWebEngineSettings::WebAttribute

    This enum type specifies settings for web pages:

    \value  AutoLoadImages
            Automatically loads images on web pages. Enabled by default.
    \value  JavascriptEnabled
            Enables the running of JavaScript programs. Enabled by default.
    \value  JavascriptCanOpenWindows
            Allows JavaScript programs to open new windows. Enabled by default.
    \value  JavascriptCanAccessClipboard
            Allows JavaScript programs to read from and write to the clipboard. Disabled by
            default.
    \value  LinksIncludedInFocusChain
            Includes hyperlinks in the keyboard focus chain. Enabled by default.
    \value  LocalStorageEnabled
            Enables support for the HTML 5 local storage feature. Enabled by default.
    \value  LocalContentCanAccessRemoteUrls
            Allows locally loaded documents to ignore cross-origin rules so that they can access
            remote resources that would normally be blocked, because all remote resources are
            considered cross-origin for a local file. Remote access that would not be blocked by
            cross-origin rules is still possible when this setting is disabled (default).
            Note that disabling this setting does not stop XMLHttpRequests or media elements in
            local files from accessing remote content. Basically, it only stops some HTML
            subresources, such as scripts, and therefore disabling this setting is not a safety
            mechanism.
    \value  XSSAuditingEnabled
            Monitors load requests for cross-site scripting attempts. Suspicious scripts are blocked
            and reported in the inspector's JavaScript console. Disabled by default, because it
            might negatively affect performance.
    \value  SpatialNavigationEnabled
            Enables the Spatial Navigation feature, which means the ability to navigate between
            focusable elements, such as hyperlinks and form controls, on a web page by using the
            Left, Right, Up and Down arrow keys. For example, if a user presses the
            Right key, heuristics determine whether there is an element they might be
            trying to reach towards the right and which element they probably want.
            Disabled by default.
    \value  LocalContentCanAccessFileUrls
            Allows locally loaded documents to access other local URLs. Enabled by default.
    \value  HyperlinkAuditingEnabled
            Enables support for the \c ping attribute for hyperlinks. Disabled by default.
    \value  ScrollAnimatorEnabled
            Enables animated scrolling. Disabled by default.
    \value  ErrorPageEnabled
            Enables displaying the built-in error pages of Chromium. Enabled by default.
    \value  PluginsEnabled
            Enables support for Pepper plugins, such as the Flash player. Disabled by default.
            See also \l{Pepper Plugin API Support}. (Added in Qt 5.6)
    \value  FullScreenSupportEnabled
            Enables fullscreen support in an application. Disabled by default. (Added in Qt 5.6)
