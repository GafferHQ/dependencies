    \title Qt WebEngine Overview

    The Qt WebEngine module provides a web browser engine that makes it easy to embed content from
    the World Wide Web into your Qt application on platforms that do not have a native web engine.
    The web engine is not intended to function as a \e {Web Runtime}; to display web content in a
    QML application by using APIs native to the platform, use the \l{Qt WebView} module, instead.

    Qt WebEngine provides C++ classes and QML types for rendering HTML, XHTML, and SVG documents,
    styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripted with JavaScript. HTML documents can be
    made fully editable by the user through the use of the \c{contenteditable} attribute on HTML
    elements.

    Qt WebEngine supercedes the \l{http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.3/qtwebkit-index.html}{Qt WebKit}
    module, which is based on the
    WebKit project, but has not been actively synchronized with the upstream WebKit code since
    Qt 5.2 and has been deprecated in Qt 5.5. For tips on how to change a Qt WebKit widgets
    application to use Qt WebEngine widgets, see \l{Porting from Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine}. For new
    applications, we recommend using Qt Quick and the WebEngineView QML type.

    For more information about the requirements for building Qt WebEngine from source on the
    supported platforms and for other platform-specific information, see
    \l{Qt WebEngine Platform Notes}.

    The \l {Qt WebChannel} module can be used to create a bi-directional communication channel
    between QObject objects on the C++ side and JavaScript on the QML side.

    \section1 Qt WebEngine Architecture

    \image qtwebengine-architecture.png

    The functionality in Qt WebEngine is divided into the following modules:

    \list
        \li \l{Qt WebEngine Widgets} for creating widget-based web applications
        \li \l{Qt WebEngine} for creating Qt Quick based web applications
        \li \l{Qt WebEngine Core} for interacting with Chromium
    \endlist

    Page rendering and JavaScript execution are separated from the GUI process into the Qt WebEngine
    Process. It is a library that must be shipped with the application if the Qt libraries are
    bundled into the application.

    \section2 Qt WebEngine Widgets

    \image qtwebenginewidgets-model.png

    A \e {web engine view} is the main widget component of the Qt WebEngine module. It can be used
    in various applications to load web content. Within a view, a \e {web engine page} holds a main
    frame that is responsible for web content, the \e history of navigated links, and \e actions.
    The view and page are quite similar, as they provide a set of common functions.

    All pages belong to a \e {web engine profile} that contains shared \e settings, \e scripts, and
    \e cookies. Profiles can be used to isolate pages from each other. A typical use case is a
    dedicated profile for a \e {private browsing} mode, where no information is permanently saved.

    \section2 Qt WebEngine

    \image qtwebengine-model.png

    The Qt WebEngine QML implementation contains the same elements as the C++ implementation,
    except that there is no separately accessible web engine page. The supported page functionality
    is integrated into the web engine view.

    \section2 Qt WebEngine Core

    The Qt WebEngine core is based on the \l {Chromium Project}. Chromium provides its own network
    and painting engines and is developed tightly together with its dependent modules, and
    therefore Qt WebEngine provides better and more reliable support for the latest HTML5
    specification than Qt WebKit. However, Qt WebEngine is thus heavier than Qt WebKit and does
    not provide direct access to the network stack and the HTML document through C++ APIs.

    Please note that Qt WebEngine is based on Chromium, but does not contain or use any services
    or add-ons that might be part of the Chrome browser that is built and delivered by Google.
    You can find more detailed information about the differences between Chromium and Chrome in this
    \l{https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/chromium_browser_vs_google_chrome.md}{overview}
    that is part of the documentation in the \l {Chromium Project} upstream source tree.

    This version of Qt WebEngine is based on Chromium snapshot version 45.0.2554.101, with
    additional security fixes from the 46, 47 and 48 branches of the \l {Chromium Project}.

    \section2 Qt WebEngine Process

    The Qt WebEngine Process renders web pages and executes JavaScript.

    Chromium is tightly integrated to the \l{Qt Quick Scene Graph}{Qt Quick scene graph}, which is
    based on OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL 2.0 for its rendering. This provides you with one-pass
    compositing of web content and all the Qt Quick UI. The integration to Chromium is transparent
    to developers, who just work with Qt and JavaScript.

    The document object model (DOM) of a page is constructed when the document is ready, typically
    when the page is completely loaded. Therefore, executing scripts as soon as a document is
    created is not suitable for DOM operations, where one has to wait until the DOM is ready.

    In addition, an injected script shares the same \e world as the other scripts executed on the
    page, which might lead to conflicts. To avoid this, the QWebEngineScript class and the
    WebEngineScript QML type provide implementations of the Chromium API for
    \e{Content Script Extensions}. They specify the
    script to run, the injection point, and the world where the script is run. This enables
    accessing the DOM to manipulate it within a world.

    \note Chromium extensions, such as \c @include, \c @match, and \c @exclude, are not supported.

    Because the render process is separated from the GUI process, they should ideally share an
    OpenGL context to enable one process to access the resources uploaded by the other, such as
    images or textures. However, some inter-process communication is needed for safety and
    reliability, because it enables restarting a crashed process.

    \section1 Embedding Web Content into Widget Based Applications

    Use the QWebEngineView class to display web pages in the simplest way. Because it is a widget,
    you can embed QWebEngineView into your forms and use its convenience functions to download and
    display web sites.

    \code
    QWebEngineView *view = new QWebEngineView(parent);
    view->load(QUrl("http://www.qt.io/"));
    view->show();
    \endcode

    An instance of QWebEngineView has one QWebEnginePage. QWebEnginePage can have a
    QWebEngineHistory that provides access to the page's navigation history and several QAction
    objects that apply actions on the web page. In addition, a QWebEnginePage has the ability to
    run JavaScript code in the context of the page's main frame and to enable customization of
    handlers for specific events like showing custom authentication dialogs.

    Each QWebEnginePage belongs to a QWebEngineProfile that can have a QWebEngineSettings
    for specifying page settings, a QWebEngineScriptCollection for running scripts on the page, and
    a QWebEngineCookieStore for accessing the HTTP cookies of Chromium. A QWebEnginePage can also
    directly point to a script collection.

    For a widget based application, the web engine is automatically initialized, unless it is
    placed in a plugin. In that case, it must be initialized in the application main source file
    by using \l QtWebEngine::initialize, as illustrated by the following code snippet:

    \code
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        QApplication app(argc, argv);

        QtWebEngine::initialize();

        QMainWindow window;
        window.show();

        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    \section1 Embedding Web Content into Qt Quick Applications

    The WebEngineView QML type allows Qt Quick applications to render regions of dynamic web
    content. A \e{WebEngineView} type may share the screen with other QML types or encompass the
    full screen as specified within the Qt Quick application.

    To make sure that OpenGL context can be shared between the GUI and render processes, the web
    engine must be initialized by using \l QtWebEngine::initialize in the application main source
    file, as illustrated by the following code snippet:

    \quotefromfile webengine/minimal/main.cpp
    \skipto main
    \printuntil }

    An application can load pages into the WebEngineView, using either an URL or HTML string, and
    navigate within session history. By default, links to different pages load within the same
    WebEngineView object, but web sites may request them to be opened as a new tab, window, or
    dialog.

    The following sample QML application loads a web page using the \l{WebEngineView::}{url}
    property:

    \quotefromfile webengine/minimal/main.qml
    \skipto import
    \printuntil /^\}/

    \section1 Managing Certificates

    Qt WebEngine uses its own network stack, and therefore QSslConfiguration is not used to
    open SSL connections. Instead, Qt WebEngine uses the root CA certificates from the operating
    system to validate the peer's certificate.

    The \l{WebEngineCertificateError::error} and \l{QWebEngineCertificateError::Error} enumerations
    provide information about the types of certificate errors that might occur. The errors can be
    handled by using the WebEngineView::certificateError QML method or by reimplementing the
    QWebEnginePage::certificateError function.

    \section1 Proxy Support

    If QNetworkProxy::applicationProxy is set, it will also be used for Qt WebEngine. Otherwise,
    Qt WebEngine automatically picks up the proxy configuration from OS X and Windows. On Linux,
    it acknowledges settings from KDE and Gnome.

    If a proxy requires authentication, QWebEnginePage::proxyAuthenticationRequired is emitted.
    For Qt Quick, a dialog is shown.

    \section1 Using WebEngine Core

    Qt WebEngine Core provides an API shared by Qt WebEngine and Qt WebEngine Widgets for handling
    URL requests issued for the networking stack of Chromium and for accessing its HTTP cookies.

    Implementing the QWebEngineUrlRequestInterceptor interface and installing the interceptor on a
    profile enables intercepting, blocking, and modifying URL requests (QWebEngineUrlRequestInfo)
    before they reach the networking stack of Chromium.

    A QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler can be registered for a profile to add support for custom URL
    schemes. Requests for the scheme are then issued to QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler::requestStarted()
    as QWebEngineUrlRequestJob objects.

    The QWebEngineCookieStore class provides functions for accessing HTTP cookies of Chromium.
    The functions can be used to synchronize cookies with QNetworkAccessManager, as well as to set,
    delete, and intercept cookies during navigation.
