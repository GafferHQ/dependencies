Build Instructions
==================

V8 gyp is not quite standard and Chromium uses a Python script
to work around that, for now we have some manual steps to do
before you can compile and run this sample:

1. Uncomment out the v8 dep in DEPS and re-run gclient sync.
2. Run 'make dependencies' in third_pary/externals/v8.
3. Run 'make native' in third_pary/externals/v8.
4. Uncomment SkV8Example in gyp/everything.gyp.
5. Run 'ninja -C out/Debug SkV8Example'
6. Run the sample as:
     ./out/Debug/SkV8Example --infile experimental/SkV8Example/js/speed.js
