This directory contains a set of dependencies that are needed to build various
components and tools within Skia.  Some of these dependencies reside within
the Skia repo, while others are pulled from other repositories and placed
in the third_party/externals directory. These external dependencies are defined
in a DEPS file and are kept up-to-date using 'gclient sync'.
