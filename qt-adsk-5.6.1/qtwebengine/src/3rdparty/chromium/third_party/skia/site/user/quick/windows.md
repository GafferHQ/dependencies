Windows
=======

Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure the following have been installed:

  * Visual C++ 2013 Express or later, available for free
    * http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-8

  * Chromium depot_tools
    * http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools
  * git
    * Either use the mysygit installed by depot_tools
    * Or install msys git: http://msysgit.github.io/ yourself
  * Python 2.7.x (if you're not planning to use cygwin)
    * available for free download at http://www.python.org/download/releases/
    * make sure the installer changes your %PATH% environment variable to include the directory with the "python.exe" binary
  * Cygwin (optional, but useful if you want to use git)
    * Download from  http://cygwin.org/setup.exe
    * use any mirror you like; http://lug.mtu.edu works well
    * Cygwin installs a minimum of options. Add these packages if they aren't already selected:
      * Devel git
      * Devel subversion
      * Editors vim
        * to fix arrows in insert, copy /usr/share/vim/vim73/vimrc_example.vim to ~/.vimrc
      * Net ca-certificates
      * Python python
      * Utils patch
      * Utils util-linux
    * set the windows envionment variable CYGWIN to nodosfilewarning

Generate Visual Studio projects
-------------------------------

We use the open-source gyp tool to generate Visual Studio projects (and
analogous build scripts on other platforms) from our multi-platform "gyp"
files.

You can generate the Visual Studio projects by running gyp_skia, as follows:

    cd %SKIA_CHECKOUT_DIR%
    python gyp_skia

This will produce Visual Studio projects in the `%SKIA_CHECKOUT_DIR%\out` directory.

Build and run tests from the command line
-----------------------------------------

    ninja -C out\Debug dm
    out\Debug\dm

Normally you should run tests in Debug mode (SK_DEBUG is defined, and debug
symbols are included in the binary). If you would like to build the Release
version instead:

    ninja -C out\Release dm
    out\Release\dm

Build and run tests in the Visual Studio IDE
--------------------------------------------

  * Generate the Visual Studio project files by running gyp_skia as described above
  * Open a File Explorer window pointing at the %SKIA_CHECKOUT_DIR%\out\gyp directory
  * Double-click on dm.sln to start Visual Studio and load the project
  * When Visual Studio starts, you may see an error dialog stating that "One or more projects in the solution were not loaded correctly"... but there's probably nothing to worry about.
  * In the "Solution Explorer" window, right-click on the "dm" project and select "Set as StartUp Project".
  * In the "Debug" menu, click on "Start Debugging" (or just press F5). If you get a dialog saying that the project is out of date, click on "Yes" to rebuild it.
  * Once the build is complete, you should see console output from the tests in the "Output" window at lower right.

Build and run SampleApp in Visual Studio
----------------------------------------

  * Generate the Visual Studio project files by running gyp_skia as described above
  * Open a File Explorer window pointing at the %SKIA_INSTALLDIR%\trunk\out\gyp directory
  * Double-click on SampleApp.sln
  * When Visual Studio starts, you may see an error dialog stating that "One or more projects in the solution were not loaded correctly"... but there's probably nothing to worry about.
  * In the "Debug" menu, click on "Start Debugging" (or just press F5). If you get a dialog saying that the project is out of date, click on "Yes" to rebuild it.
  * Once the build is complete, you should see a window with various example graphics. To move through the sample app, use the following keypresses:
    * right-arrow key: cycle through different test pages
    * left-arrow key: cycle through rendering methods for each test page
    * other keys are defined in SampleApp.cppâ€™s SampleWindow::onHandleKey() and SampleWindow::onHandleChar() methods

Build and run nanobench (performance testbench) from the command line
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Since nanobench tests performance, it usually makes more sense to run it in Release mode.

    ninja -C out\Release nanobench
    out\Release\nanobench
