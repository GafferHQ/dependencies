Commit Queue Keywords
=====================

COMMIT
------

If you are working on experimental code and do not want to risk accidentally
submitting the change via the CQ, then you can mark it with "COMMIT=false".
The CQ will immediately abandon the change if it contains this option.
To do a dry run through the CQ please use Rietveld's [dry run](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-dev/G5-X0_tfmok) feature.

    COMMIT=false

The CQ will run through its list of verifiers (reviewer check, trybots, tree check, 
presubmit check), and will close the issue instead of committing it.

    CQ_INCLUDE_TRYBOTS

Allows you to add arbitrary trybots to the CQ's list of default trybots. 
The CQ will block till these tryjobs pass just like the default list of tryjobs.

This is the format of the values of this keyword:

    CQ_INCLUDE_TRYBOTS=master1:bot1,bot2;master2:bot3,bot4

Here are some real world examples:

    CQ_INCLUDE_TRYBOTS=tryserver.chromium:linux_layout_rel

    CQ_INCLUDE_TRYBOTS=tryserver.skia:Build-Mac10.9-Clang-x86_64-Debug

    CQ_EXCLUDE_TRYBOTS

Allows you to remove trybots from the CQ's list of default trybots. Should only be 
used when particular builders are failing for reasons unrelated to your code changes.

This is the format of the values of this keyword:

    CQ_EXCLUDE_TRYBOTS=master1:bot1,bot2;master2:bot3,bot4

Here are some real world examples:

    CQ_EXCLUDE_TRYBOTS=tryserver.chromium:win_chromium_compile_dbg

    CQ_EXCLUDE_TRYBOTS=tryserver.skia:Build-Win7-VS2010-x86-Debug-Trybot

    CQ_TRYBOTS

Allows you to list every trybot that you want to run for your CL.

This is the format of the values of this keyword:

    CQ_TRYBOTS=master1:bot1,bot2;master2:bot3,bot4

Here are some real world examples:

    CQ_TRYBOTS=tryserver.chromium:linux_chromium_gn_rel,linux_chromium_chromeos_rel,
      android_dbg_triggered_tests,android_dbg,mac_chromium_rel,win_chromium_x64_rel

    CQ_TRYBOTS=tryserver.skia:Build-Win7-VS2010-x86-Debug-Trybot,
      Test-Ubuntu13.10-ShuttleA-NoGPU-x86_64-Debug-Trybot,
      Build-Ubuntu13.10-GCC4.8-x86_64-Release-Trybot,
      Build-Ubuntu13.10-Clang-x86_64-Debug-Trybot,Build-Mac10.8-Clang-x86_64-Release-Trybot 

TBR
---

If you are a Skia committer and cannot wait for a review, 
then you can include the TBR keyword in your CL's description.

Example:

    TBR=rmistry@google.com

    NOTREECHECKS

If you want to skip the tree status checks, to make the CQ commit a CL even if the tree is closed, 
you can add the following line to the CL description:

    NOTREECHECKS=true

This is discouraged, since the tree is closed for a reason. However, in rare cases this is acceptable, 
primarily to fix build breakages (i.e., your CL will help in reopening the tree).

    NOPRESUBMIT

If you want to skip the presubmit checks, add the following line to the CL description:

    NOPRESUBMIT=true

NOTRY
-----

If you cannot wait for the try job results, you can add the following line to the CL description:

    NOTRY=true

The CQ will then not run any try jobs for your change and will commit the CL as soon as the tree is open, assuming the presubmit check passes.

NO_MERGE_BUILDS
---------------

This keyword prevents the Skia build masters from building this commit with others. Use it when your
commit may have effects that you don't want mis-attributed to other commits. Just include the keyword
somewhere in the commit message:

    NO_MERGE_BUILDS
