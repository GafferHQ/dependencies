         Rules for commits on the libxslt module
         =======================================

If what you are fixing is a compilation issue either at compile
time or linking time on one of the main Linux platforms, then feel free
to patch first and send mail afterward, as long as it's a 'small fix'.

Otherwise, only Bjorn Reese (breese@users.sourceforge.net), 
"William M. Brack" <wbrack@mmm.com.hk>, Igor Zlatkovic
<igor@zlatkovic.com> and me (veillard@redhat.com)
should commit there. John Fleck also have commit rights for the doc
subdir. Send a mail and if it's a bug issue, provide a test case and
register it at bugzilla.gnome.org in the libxslt module.
I check both my mail and the bug database on a very regular basis.
if you don't get an answer within a week (which is highly unprobable)
then commit your changes. This simply mean that I am on holliday or
on the road and the other maintainers are busy too.

  thanks in advance for following the rule,

Daniel
