<translation id="4818993768077639880">Chromium is already installed and available to all users of this computer. If you want to install Chromium at the user level, you must first uninstall the system-level version installed by an administrator.</translation>
<translation id="4890456338028740446">You attempted to reach &lt;strong&gt;<ph name="DOMAIN"/>&lt;/strong&gt;, but the server presented a certificate issued by an entity that is not trusted by your computer's operating system. This may mean that the server has generated its own security credentials, which Chromium cannot rely on for identity information, or an attacker may be trying to intercept your communications. You should not proceed, &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; if you have never seen this warning before for this site.</translation>
<translation id="4931128279570440880">In this case, the address listed in the certificate does not match the address of the website your browser tried to go to. One possible reason for this is that your communications are being intercepted by an attacker who is presenting a certificate for a different website, which would cause a mismatch. Another possible reason is that the server is set up to return the same certificate for multiple websites, including the one you are attempting to visit, even though that certificate is not valid for all of those websites. Chromium can say for sure that you reached &lt;strong&gt;<ph name="DOMAIN2"/>&lt;/strong&gt;, but cannot verify that that is the same site as &lt;strong&gt;<ph name="DOMAIN"/>&lt;/strong&gt; which you intended to reach. If you proceed, Chromium will not check for any further name mismatches. In general, it is best not to proceed past this point.</translation>
