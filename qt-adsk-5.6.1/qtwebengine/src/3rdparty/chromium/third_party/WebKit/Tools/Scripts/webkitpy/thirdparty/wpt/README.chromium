W3C Web Platform Tests in Blink Layout Tests

Design Doc: https://goo.gl/iXUaZd

This directory contains checked out and reduced code from web-platform-tests
(https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/) required to run WPT tests as part
of Blink's test infrastructure and some maintenance/configuration code.

The third party code lives entirely in the wpt subdirectory:
Tools/Scripts/webkitpy/thirdparty/wpt/wpt

Besides the reduced web-platform-tests repository, the wpt subdirectory also
contains wpt/tools submodule (https://github.com/w3c/wpt-tools) and
wpt/tools/wptserve (https://github.com/w3c/wptserve) directories.

For licensing, see README.chromium in parent directory
(Tools/Scripts/webkitpy/thirdparty/README.chromium).

Files in this directory (non third-party)

README.chromium
===============
This file.

wpt.config.json
===============
The configuration file used when running WPTServe. Note that this file loads
after wpt/config.default.json and this configuration gets merged onto it. When
changing the ports (HTTP/S, WS/S), make sure to update the python code too.

checkout.sh
===========
Running this script without arguments will remove the existing checkout
(thirdparty/wpt/wpt) and perform a fresh one. See "Rolling in WPT" for more.

WPTHeads
========
List of git commit-ish for the WPT repositories. File format is as follows:
First line: HEAD position for web-platform-tests.
Rest of lines: parent directory, submodule name, HEAD position for submodule.
The submodule checkout is performed in order when running ./checkout.sh.

WPTWhiteList
============
The explicit list of files being kept, everything else not on this list is
deleted when running "./checkout.sh reduce". Use this file to control what gets
checked in and try to keep the list as small as possible (use what you need).

**

Rolling in WPT

When rolling in new versions of WPT support, use WPTHeads to adjust the HEAD
positions. You can then call "./checkout.sh clone" which will pull in all the
code and required submodules.

You can check in the latest code by setting the HEAD commit-ish to "master" on
each line, afterwards make sure to use the actual SHA1s to lock down the HEAD
positions. It is also important to update the hashes in the 'Version:' fields of
Tools/Scripts/webkitpy/thirdparty/README.chromium.

You can examine what's pulled in and update WPTWhiteList if some new files are
required to run the updated version.

Once you've cloned the repositories you can call "./checkout.sh reduce" to
remove everything that is not listed in WPTWhiteList.

Note that calling "./checkout.sh" without arguments is equivalent of calling
"./checkout.sh clone reduce".

Configuration

Read instructions in WPT README:
https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/blob/master/README.md

Also, check out the WPTServe Documentation
(https://wptserve.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

For setting up SSL, refer to Tools/Scripts/webkitpy/thirdparty/wpt/wpt/_certs
(which gets generated on the first run).

Note that editing /etc/hosts is not required for run-webkit-tests since
content_shell is invoked with flags to map all *.test domains to 127.0.0.1.

**

Running web-platform-tests with enabled WPTServe on a local machine

Starting run-webkit-tests with the --enable-wptserve flag will start WPTServe
for tests which live in LayoutTests/imported/web-platform-tests.

WPTServe starts HTTP/S and WS/S servers as separate processes.

The content_shell used to run the tests will receive the URL of each test
(instead of a filename). The document root http://web-platform.test/ maps to
LayoutTests/imported/web-platform-tests. HTTPS tests are enabled by default.

Example run:

./Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-tests \
    --debug \
    --enable-wptserve \
    --no-new-test-results \
    imported/web-platform-tests
