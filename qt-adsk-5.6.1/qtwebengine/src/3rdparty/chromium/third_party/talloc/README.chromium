The talloc library is only being used by a portion of the Mesa
software renderer, in ../mesa/MesaLib, and is only linked in to the
OSMesa shared library.

This is version 2.0.1 of talloc, with the following modifications (see
chromium.patch):

 - #include "replace.h" was commented out in talloc.c.
 - "bool malloced" was changed to "int malloced" in talloc.c.
 - #include string.h, and conditional #include of stdint.h, were added
   to talloc.h.
 - Uses of the "inline" keyword were made conditional and disabled on
   Windows.
 - A "min_size" inline function was used in place of the MIN macro.
 - An implementation of strnlen was provided for platforms not
   supporting it (in particular, Mac OS X).
 - A use of ssize_t was changed to size_t on Windows.
 - a call to vsnprintf() querying the required buffer size was changed to use
   ptr NULL size 0 in order to satisfy MSVC
