Description:
libexif is a library for parsing, editing, and saving EXIF data. Many maker
notes from Canon, Casio, Epson, Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and Sanyo cameras
are also supported.

Local Modifications:
- Added license header to exif-mem.c. Please refer to chromium.patch.
- config.h and _stdint.h has been modified to build on all platforms. Please
  refer to chromium.patch.
- Added BIND_TEXTDOMAIN macro to conditionally bind the text domain to locale
  directory. Please refer to chromium.patch.
- Removed ABOUT-NLS, *.m4, *-m4, binary, ChangeLog, config*, contrib, depcomp,
  INSTALL, install-sh, Makefile-files, *.sym, *.am, *.in, *.pc.in, *.spec, *.sh
  and *.txt files.
- Removed "doc", "po", "NEWS", "mkinstalldirs", "missing", "nls" folders.
- Removed inline from exif_tag_table_count function in exif-tag.c, to build
  cleanly with MSVC's non-standard inline rules.
