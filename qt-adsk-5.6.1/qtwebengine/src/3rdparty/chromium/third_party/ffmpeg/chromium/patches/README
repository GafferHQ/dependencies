Current Status as of July 30, 2015

Upstream cherry-picks:
  f8b81a02c980609c450992a0c261330a1ae95d86 - Fixes ogg seeking.

Current patches:
  autorename_* files are renamed copies of various files that would cause
    base name collisions from mac libtool. These files are generated
    by generate_gyp.py. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/274543v/

  Change libavcodec/internal.h ff_tlong define from while(0) to (void(0)).
    This fixes "while loop has empty body" compile errors.

  Changes/additions to libavutil/x86/x86inc.asm
    https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/272274/
    Fixes the conditionals on Linux so that these symbols are hidden and
    adds the Chromium-specific private_extern extension for hiding these
    symbols on OSX.

  Changes/additions to compat/msvcrt/{snprintf.h,strtod.h}
    Commit b5269bfb48c71fe17c02eee00c71b1e9762497db changes these files and
    relevant build rules to fix inconsistent linkage when building with MSVC.
    The rules/files expose overriden symbols as externs and force inject these
    headers when building with the component build.

  Remove UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER defines
    Remove "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs. In Chromium
    all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

  Changes to libavformat/matroskadec.c
    Remove extra const from static EbmlSyntax arrays. This fixes windows
    compile error C4114, since EbmlSyntax struct is already defined with const.
    TODO: push upstream.

    Add CONFIG_SIPR_DECODER and CONFIG_LZO checks to remove code that may be a
    security risk. Discuss with cevans before removing.

    Add call to matroska_read_close() to mitigate memory leak caught by
    valgrind.

  Preserve AVCodecID enum in libavcodec/avcodec.h (http://crbug.com/241212)
    Insert AV_CODEC_ID_SNOW into the AVCodecID enum to avoid breaking
    histograms.

  Fix pthreads emulation on Windows XP
    Emulation assumes Vista+ inside (_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0600) checks. Replace
    with WINDOWS_XP_SUPPORT_NEEDED define in compat/w32pthreads.h.

    Add call to w32thread_init() in libavcodec/vp8.c.

  Disable FMA3 instructions in libavutil/log.c (http://crbug.com/440892)
    Remove call to _set_FMA3_enable() on Windows. Remove once we are using
    VS2015.

  C++11 compatability for string concatenation (http://crbug.com/454590)
    Add spaces between string literals and tokens in libavutil/timer.h and
    libavutil/internal.h.

  Check the return value of init_get_bits in libavformat/oggparsedirac.c.
    If it fails, the GetBitContext is invalid and mustn't be used.

  Change printf format specifier for enum from PRIu8 to %d in libavformat/mov.

  Misc things that were not documented
    Enable av_max_alloc(0) to remove alloc size bound in libavutil/mem.c.

    Misc changes in libavformat/mp3dec.c.

    Add FF_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS/FF_ENABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS pairs in
    libavformat/mux.c.

    Remove static av_always_inline av_const unsigned av_clip_uintp2_arm() and
    av_clip_intp2_arm() from libavutil/arm/intmath.h due to compilation failure.
