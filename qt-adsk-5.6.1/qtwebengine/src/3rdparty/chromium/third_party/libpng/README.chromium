Description:
Updated to 1.2.56, no changes to the source files but all unneeded files
stripped.

Our custom configuration options are defined in pngusr.h. This was previously
called mozpngconf.h, which was copied from Mozilla and modified by Apple (hence
the wk_* names):
- Unset PNG_NO_READ_PACK on Android in pngusr.h, required by freetype to support
  color glyphs.
- Configure PNG chunk user limits (crbug.com/117369)
