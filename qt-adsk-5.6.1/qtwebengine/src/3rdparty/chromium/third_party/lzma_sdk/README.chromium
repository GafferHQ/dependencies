Description:
This contains a part of LZMA SDK 9.20.

Only the C code required to open 7z archive files and uncompress LZMA
compression has been included. The project files have been rewritten to use
proper file paths and generate a static lib.

The patch in chromium.patch was applied to CpuArch.c to fix compile error on
32bit Linux (when compiled with -fPIC).

2013-06-14: The patch was updated to fix register corruption that can occur on
64-bit platforms.

2013-07-17: The patch was updated to fix register clobbering that occurred on
Mac builds (but in principle can occur anywhere).

An #include <stdlib.h> needs to be added to CpuArch.h to avoid a warning on
Win32.
