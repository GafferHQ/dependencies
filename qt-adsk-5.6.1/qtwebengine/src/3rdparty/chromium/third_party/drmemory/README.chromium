Description:
This directory contains a self-extracting 7z file with Dr. Memory
(which is a Memcheck analog with Windows support) to be used
by Chromium Dr. Memory/Windows buildbots and Chromium developers.

More info on using Dr. Memory for testing Chromium can be found here:
http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/using-drmemory

To update the Dr. Memory distribution, please do the following steps:
0) Download the latest package from
   http://build.chromium.org/p/client.drmemory/builds/
   e.g.:
   $ curl -s http://build.chromium.org/p/client.drmemory/builds/drmemory-windows-rXXX-sfx.exe -o drmemory-windows-sfx.exe

1) Upload the package to Google Storage:
   $ upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket chromium-drmemory drmemory-windows-sfx.exe
   This will produce a file drmemory-windows-sfx.exe.sha1 in the current 
   directory.

2) Replace the existing drmemory-windows-sfx.exe.sha1 file with the new
   file created by the upload step.

3) Update the README.chromium file's Version field.

4) Commit the sha1 and README.chromium changes locally and upload the CL.

5) Run a trybot job to the bot named "win_drmemory", e.g.:
   git cl try -b win_drmemory

6) If the trybot is green, commit the new sha1 file and README.chromium.
   If it's red, find out if it's due to broken DrMemory binaries that you just
   checked in, or whether the MFYI bot was red at the same revision.
