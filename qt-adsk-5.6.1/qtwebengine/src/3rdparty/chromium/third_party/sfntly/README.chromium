Description:
sfntly is a C++ library for using, editing, and creating sfnt container based
fonts (e.g. OpenType, TrueType).  We use it to subset the embedded font in the
PDF generated in print preview so that the result PDF documents are
significantly smaller and loaded faster.

Local files (not taken from upstream):
README.chromium

COPYING.txt is the license file copied from upstream.
A sfntly.gyp file has been added for building with Chromium.
