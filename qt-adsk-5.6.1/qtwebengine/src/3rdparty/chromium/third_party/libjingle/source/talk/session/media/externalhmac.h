// External libsrtp HMAC auth module which implements methods defined in
// auth_type_t.
// The default auth module will be replaced only when the ENABLE_EXTERNAL_AUTH
// flag is enabled. This allows us to access to authentication keys,
// as the default auth implementation doesn't provide access and avoids
// hashing each packet twice.

// How will libsrtp select this module?
// Libsrtp defines authentication function types identified by an unsigned
// integer, e.g. HMAC_SHA1 is 3. Using authentication ids, the application
// can plug any desired authentication modules into libsrtp.
// libsrtp also provides a mechanism to select different auth functions for
// individual streams. This can be done by setting the right value in
// the auth_type of srtp_policy_t. The application must first register auth
// functions and the corresponding authentication id using
// crypto_kernel_replace_auth_type function.
