= generate_dump(1)

== Name

generate_dump - Generate a minidump file containing a snapshot of a running
process

== Synopsis

[verse]
*generate_dump* ['OPTION…'] 'PID'

== Description

Generates a minidump file containing a snapshot of a running process whose
process identifier is 'PID'. By default, the target process will be suspended
while the minidump is generated, and the minidump file will be written to
+minidump.PID+. After the minidump file is generated, the target process resumes
running.

The minidump file will contain information about the process, its threads, its
modules, and the system. It will not contain any exception information because
it will be generated from a live running process, not as a result of an
exception occurring.

This program uses +task_for_pid()+ to access the process’ task port. This
operation may be restricted to use by the superuser, executables signed by an
authority trusted by the system, and processes otherwise permitted by
taskgated(8). Consequently, this program must normally either be signed or be
invoked by root. It is possible to install this program as a setuid root
executable to overcome this limitation.

This program is similar to the gcore(1) program available on some operating
systems.

== Options

*-r*, *--no-suspend*::
The target process will continue running while the minidump file is generated.
Normally, the target process is suspended during this operation, which
guarantees that the minidump file will contain an atomic snapshot of the
process.
+
This option may be useful when attempting to generate a minidump from a process
that dump generation has an interprocess dependency on, such as a system server
like launchd(8) or opendirectoryd(8). Deadlock could occur if any portion of the
dump generation operation blocks while waiting for a response from one of these
servers while they are suspended.

*-o*, *--output*='FILE'::
The minidump will be written to 'FILE' instead of +minidump.PID+.

*--help*::
Display help and exit.

*--version*::
Output version information and exit.

== Examples

Generate a minidump file in +/tmp/minidump+ containing a snapshot of the process
with PID 1234.
