= run_with_crashpad(1)

== Name

run_with_crashpad - Run a program with a Crashpad exception handler

== Synopsis

[verse]
*run_with_crashpad* ['OPTION…'] 'COMMAND' ['ARG…']

== Description

Starts a Crashpad exception handler server such as crashpad_handler(8) and
becomes its client, setting an exception port referencing the handler. Then,
executes 'COMMAND' along with any arguments specified ('ARG…') with the new
exception port in effect.

The exception port is configured to receive exceptions of type +EXC_CRASH+,
+EXC_RESOURCE+, and +EXC_GUARD+. The exception behavior is configured as
+EXCEPTION_STATE_IDENTITY | MACH_EXCEPTION_CODES+. The thread state flavor is
set to +MACHINE_THREAD_STATE+.

Programs that use the Crashpad client library directly will not normally use
this tool. This tool exists to allow programs that are unaware of Crashpad to be
run with a Crashpad exception handler.

== Options
*-h*, *--handler*='HANDLER'::
Invoke 'HANDLER' as the Crashpad handler program instead of the default,
*crashpad_handler*.

*--annotation*='KEY=VALUE'::
Passed to the Crashpad handler program as an *--annotation* argument.

*--database*='PATH'::
Passed to the Crashpad handler program as its *--database* argument.

*--url*='URL'::
Passed to the Crashpad handler program as its *--url* argument.

*-a*, *--argument*='ARGUMENT'::
Invokes the Crashpad handler program with 'ARGUMENT' as one of its arguments.
This option may appear zero, one, or more times. If this program has a specific
option such as *--database* matching the desired Crashpad handler program
option, the specific option should be used in preference to *--argument*.
Regardless of this option’s presence, the handler will always be invoked with
the necessary arguments to perform a handshake.

*--help*::
Display help and exit.

*--version*::
Output version information and exit.

== Examples

Starts a Crashpad exception handler server by its default name,
*crashpad_handler*, and runs a program with this handler in effect.

Success.

*125*::
