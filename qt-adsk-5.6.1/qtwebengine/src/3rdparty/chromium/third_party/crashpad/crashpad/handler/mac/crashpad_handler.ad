== Name

crashpad_handler - Crashpad’s exception handler server

== Synopsis

[verse]
*crashpad_handler* ['OPTION…']

== Description

This program is Crashpad’s main exception-handling server. It is responsible for
catching exceptions, writing crash reports, and uploading them to a crash report
collection server. Uploads are disabled by default, and can only be enabled by a
Crashpad client using the Crashpad client library, typically in response to a
user requesting this behavior.

This server is normally started by its initial client, and it performs a
handshake with this client via a pipe established by the client that is
inherited by the server, referenced by the *--handshake-fd* argument. During the
handshake, the server furnishes the client with a send right that the client may
use as an exception port. The server retains the corresponding receive right,
which it monitors for exception messages. When the receive right loses all
senders, the server exits after allowing any upload in progress to complete.

It is not normally appropriate to invoke this program directly. Usually, it will
be invoked by a Crashpad client using the Crashpad client library. Arbitrary
programs may be run with a Crashpad handler by using
man_link:run_with_crashpad[1] to establish the Crashpad client environment
before running a program.

== Options
*--annotation*='KEY=VALUE'::
Sets a process-level annotation mapping 'KEY' to 'VALUE' in each crash report
that is written. This option may appear zero, one, or multiple times.
+
Most annotations should be provided by the Crashpad client as module-level
annotations instead of process-level annotations. Module-level annotations are
more flexible in that they can be modified and cleared during the client
program’s lifetime. Module-level annotations can be set via the Crashpad client
library. Process-level annotations are useful for annotations that the
collection server requires be present, that have fixed values, and for cases
where a program that does not use the Crashpad client library is being
monitored.
+
Breakpad-type collection servers only require the +"prod"+ and +"ver"+
annotations, which should be set to the product name or identifier and product
version, respectively. It is unusual to specify other annotations as
process-level annotations via this argument.

*--database*='PATH'::
Use 'PATH' as the path to the Crashpad crash report database. This option is
required. Crash reports are written to this database, and if uploads are
enabled, uploaded from this database to a crash report collection server. If the
database does not exist, it will be created, provided that the parent directory
of 'PATH' exists.

*--handshake-fd*='FD'::
Perform the handshake with the initial client on the file descriptor at 'FD'.
This option is required.

*--url*='URL'::
If uploads are enabled, sends crash reports to the Breakpad-type crash report
collection server at 'URL'. Uploads are disabled by default, and can only be
enabled for a database by a Crashpad client using the Crashpad client library,
typically in response to a user requesting this behavior. If this option is not
specified, this program will behave as if uploads are disabled.

*--help*::
Display help and exit.

*--version*::
Output version information and exit.

== Exit Status

*0*::
Success.

*1*::
Failure, with a message printed to the standard error stream.
