== Name

crashpad_database_util - Operate on Crashpad crash report databases

== Synopsis

[verse]
*crashpad_database_util* ['OPTION…']

== Description

Operates on Crashpad crash report databases. The database’s settings can be
queried and modified, and information about crash reports stored in the
database can be displayed.

When this program is requested to both show and set information in a single
invocation, all “show” operations will be completed prior to beginning any “set”
operation.

Programs that use the Crashpad client library directly will not normally use
this tool, but may use the database through the programmatic interfaces in the
client library. This tool exists to allow developers to manipulate a Crashpad
database.

== Options
*-d*, *--database*='PATH'::
Use 'PATH' as the path to the Crashpad crash report database. This option is
required. If the database does not exist, it will be created, provided that the
parent directory of 'PATH' exists.

*--show-client-id*::
Show the client ID stored in the database’s settings. The client ID is formatted
as a UUID. The client ID is set when the database is created.
man_link:crashpad_handler[8] retrieves the client ID and stores it in crash
reports as they are written.

*--show-uploads-enabled*::
Show the status of the uploads-enabled bit stored in the database’s settings.
man_link:crashpad_handler[8] does not upload reports when this bit is false.
This bit is false when a database is created, and is under an application’s
control via the Crashpad client library interface.
+
See also *--set-uploads-enabled*.

*--show-last-upload-attempt-time*::
Show the last-upload-attempt time stored in the database’s settings. This value
is +0+, meaning “never,” when the database is created.
man_link:crashpad_handler[8] consults this value before attempting an upload to
implement its rate-limiting behavior. The database updates this value whenever
an upload is attempted.
+
See also *--set-last-upload-attempt-time*.

*--show-pending-reports*::
Show reports eligible for upload.

*--show-completed-reports*::
Show reports not eligible for upload. A report is moved from the “pending” state
to the “completed” state by man_link:crashpad_handler[8]. This may happen when a
report is successfully uploaded, when a report is not uploaded because uploads
are disabled, or when a report upload attempt fails and will not be retried.

*--show-all-report-info*::
With *--show-pending-reports* or *--show-completed-reports*, show all metadata
for each report displayed. Without this option, only report IDs will be shown.

*--show-report*='UUID'::
Show a report from the database looked up by its identifier, 'UUID', which must
be formatted in string representation per RFC 4122 §3. All metadata for each
report found via a *--show-report* option will be shown. If 'UUID' is not found,
the string +"not found"+ will be printed. If this program is only requested to
show a single report and it is not found, it will treat this as a failure for
the purposes of determining its exit status. This option may appear multiple
times.

*--set-report-uploads-enabled*='BOOL'::
Enable or disable report upload in the database’s settings. 'BOOL' is a string
representation of a boolean value, such as +"0"+ or +"true"+.
+
See also *--show-uploads-enabled*.

*--set-last-upload-attempt-time*='TIME'::
Set the last-upload-attempt time in the database’s settings. 'TIME' is a string
representation of a time, which may be in 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss' format, a
numeric +time_t+ value, or the special string +"never"+.
+
See also *--show-last-upload-attempt-time*.

*--new-report*='PATH'::
Submit a new report located at 'PATH' to the database. The new report will be in
the “pending” state. The UUID assigned to the new report will be printed. This
option may appear multiple times.

*--utc*::
When showing times, do so in UTC as opposed to the local time zone. When setting
times, interpret ambiguous time strings in UTC as opposed to the local time
zone.

*--help*::
Display help and exit.

*--version*::
Output version information and exit.

== Examples

Shows all crash reports in a crash report database that are in the “completed”
state.
