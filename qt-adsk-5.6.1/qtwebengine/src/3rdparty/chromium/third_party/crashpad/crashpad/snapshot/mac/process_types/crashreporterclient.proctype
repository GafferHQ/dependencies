// The name of this file was chosen based on
// http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk/lib/Support/PrettyStackTrace.cpp.
// The name of the structure it describes was chosen based on that file as well
// as 10.9.2 cups-372.2/cups/backend/usb-darwin.c. That file also provided the
// names and types of the fields in the structure.
//
// This file is intended to be included multiple times in the same translation
// unit, so #include guards are intentionally absent.
//
// This file is included by snapshot/mac/process_types.h and
// snapshot/mac/process_types.cc to produce process type struct definitions and
// accessors.

// Client Mach-O images will contain a __DATA,__crash_info section formatted
// according to this structure.
