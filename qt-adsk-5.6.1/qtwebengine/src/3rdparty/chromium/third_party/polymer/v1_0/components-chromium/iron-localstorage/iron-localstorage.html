Element access to Web Storage API (window.localStorage).

Keeps `value` in sync with a localStorage key.

Direct assignments to `value` are automatically detected and saved.
Subproperty assignments are not (ex: `value.bar='foo'`).
Call `save()` manually to commit your changes after modifying subproperties.

Value is saved in localStorage as JSON by default.

If you set the value to null, storage key will be deleted.

    <iron-localstorage name="my-app-storage" value="{{value}}">
    </iron-localstorage>


<b>Warning</b>: do not pass subproperty bindings to iron-localstorage until Polymer
[bug 1550](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/1550)
is resolved. Local storage will be blown away.
No `<iron-localstorage value="{{foo.bar}}"`.
