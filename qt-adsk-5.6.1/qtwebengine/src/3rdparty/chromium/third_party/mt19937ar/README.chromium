Description:
This is Chrome's locally patched copy of Takuji Nishimura and Makoto
Matsumoto's Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator.

Note: Once Chromium moves to C++11, this can be removed in favor
of C++'s <random>.

Local Modifications:
Renamed mt19937ar.c to mt19937ar.cc and modified it to encapsulate its
state in a C++ class, rather than using global state. Changed the code to
use uint32 types instead of unsigned longs. Added a header file.
Additionally, unnecessary functions (in particular, main) were removed.
