Description:
An emulator of the Web Animations specification. Web Animations is a new
specification for animated content on the web. It's being developed as a W3C
specification as part of the CSS and SVG working groups. Latest specification at
http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/.

Used as a dependency of Polymer framework (see src/third_party/polymer/v1_0). If
using directly, rather than through Polymer, use only the minified source.
Otherwise there may be CSP issues with inline scripts, etc. This should only be
updated via third_party/polymer/v1_0/reproduce.sh after bumping the version
number in third_party/polymer/v1_0/bower.json.
