/* This file implements a PRNG by reading from /dev/urandom, optionally with a
 * fork-safe buffer.
 *
 * If buffering is enabled then it maintains a global, linked list of buffers.
 * Threads which need random bytes grab a buffer from the list under a lock and
 * copy out the bytes that they need. In the rare case that the buffer is
 * empty, it's refilled from /dev/urandom outside of the lock.
 *
 * Large requests are always serviced from /dev/urandom directly.
 *
 * Each buffer contains the PID of the process that created it and it's tested
 * against the current PID each time. Thus processes that fork will discard all
 * the buffers filled by the parent process. There are two problems with this:
 *
 * 1) glibc maintains a cache of the current PID+PPID and, if this cache isn't
 *    correctly invalidated, the getpid() will continue to believe that
 *    it's the old process. Glibc depends on the glibc wrappers for fork,
 *    vfork and clone being used in order to invalidate the getpid() cache.
 *
 * 2) If a process forks, dies and then its child forks, it's possible that
 *    the third process will end up with the same PID as the original process.
 *    If the second process never used any random values then this will mean
 *    that the third process has stale, cached values and won't notice.
