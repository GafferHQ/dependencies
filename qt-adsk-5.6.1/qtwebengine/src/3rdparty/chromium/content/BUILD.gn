# When targets depend on, e.g. //content/public/browser, what happens? To
# facilitate the complexity here, the "public" targets are groups that forward
# to the right thing depending on the build mode. Say for additional
# illustration, the public browser sources also depend on the public common
# ones.
#
# The non-component build is easy:
# foo ->
#   //content/public/browser (group) ->
#     //content/public/browser:browser_sources (source set) ->
#       //content/browser (source set, this is the non-public browser target)
#       //content/public/common:common_sources (source set)
#
# The component build is more complicated because we want everybody to depend on
# one content shared library regardless of which public target they depend on:
# foo ->
#   //content/public/browser (group) ->
#     //content (shared library) ->
#       //content/public/browser:browser_sources (source set) ->
#         //content/browser (source set; this is the non-public browser target)
#         //content/public/common:common_sources (source set)
#
# That the internal content dependencies must depend on the *_sources targets
# to avoid dependency cycles, and external dependencies must depend on the
# //content/public/browser and similar targets to avoid double-linking (these
# targets make sure the dependency goes through the content shared library
# when doing a component build).
