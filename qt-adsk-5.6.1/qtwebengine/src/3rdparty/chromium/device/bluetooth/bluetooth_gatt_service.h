// BluetoothGattService represents a local or remote GATT service. A GATT
// service is hosted by a peripheral and represents a collection of data in
// the form of GATT characteristics and a set of included GATT services if this
// service is what is called "a primary service".
//
// Instances of the BluetoothGattService class are used for two functions:
//   1. To represent GATT attribute hierarchies that have been received from a
//      remote Bluetooth GATT peripheral. Such BluetoothGattService instances
//      are constructed and owned by a BluetoothDevice.
//
//   2. To represent a locally hosted GATT attribute hierarchy when the local
//      adapter is used in the "peripheral" role. Such instances are meant to be
//      constructed directly and registered. Once registered, a GATT attribute
//      hierarchy will be visible to remote devices in the "central" role.
