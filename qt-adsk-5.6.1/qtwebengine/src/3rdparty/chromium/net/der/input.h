class Mark;

// An opaque class that represents a fixed buffer of data of a fixed length,
// to be used as an input to other operations. An Input object does not own
// the data it references, so callers are responsible for making sure that
// the data outlives the Input object and any other associated objects.
//
// All data access for an Input should be done through the ByteReader and Mark
// classes. This class and associated classes are designed with safety in mind
// to make it difficult to read memory outside of an Input. ByteReader provides
// a simple API for reading through the Input sequentially. For more
// complicated uses, multiple instances of a ByteReader for a particular Input
// can be created, and instances of Mark can be used to coordinate between the
// ByteReaders.
//
// One such use case of multiple ByteReaders would be looking ahead in an
// input: A ByteReader is copied and then is used to read some number of
// bytes into the input, based on the content it is reading. A Mark can then be
// set using the temporary ByteReader to indicate how far it read into the
// Input. The original ByteReader can then be synchronized with how far the
// temporary ByteReader read, by using either AdvanceToMark() or ReadToMark().

// This class provides ways to read data from an Input in a bounds-checked way.
// The ByteReader is designed to read through the input sequentially. Once a
// byte has been read with a ByteReader, the caller can't go back and re-read
// that byte with the same reader. Of course, the caller can create multiple
// ByteReaders for the same input (or copy an existing ByteReader).
//
// For something simple like a single byte lookahead, the easiest way to do
// that is to copy the ByteReader and call ReadByte() on the copy - the original
// ByteReader will be unaffected and the peeked byte will be read through
// ReadByte(). For other read patterns, it can be useful to mark where one is
// in a ByteReader to be able to return to that spot.
//
// Some operations using Mark can also be done by creating a copy of the
// ByteReader. By using a Mark instead, you use less memory, but more
// importantly, you end up with an immutable object that matches the semantics
// of what is intended.
