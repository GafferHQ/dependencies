Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.
http://martine.github.com/ninja/

See the manual -- http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html or
doc/manual.asciidoc included in the distribution -- for background
and more details.

To build, run ./configure.py --bootstrap.  It first compiles all non-test
source files together, then re-builds Ninja using itself.  You should
end up with a 'ninja' binary in the source root.

Run './configure.py --help' for more configuration options.
Run './ninja -h' for Ninja help.

Installation is not necessary because the only required file is is the
resulting ninja binary. However, to enable features like Bash
completion and Emacs and Vim editing modes, some files in misc/ must be
copied to appropriate locations.

If you're interested in making changes to Ninja, read HACKING.md first.
