    \title Qt 3D

    \e{Qt 3D} provides functionality for near-realtime simulation systems
    with support for 2D and 3D rendering in both Qt C++ and Qt Quick
    applications.

    The functionality in Qt 3D is divided into the following C++ modules:

    \annotatedlist qt3d-modules

    For Qt Quick applications, Qt 3D provides the following QML modules:

    \annotatedlist qt3d-qmlmodules

    \section1 Getting Started

    For a C++ application that performs 2D or 3D rendering, collision
    detection, and also handle user input, add the following line to its
    \l qmake \c .pro file:

    \badcode
    QT += 3dcore 3drender 3dinput 3dlogic
    \endcode

    To include the definitions of the modules' classes, use the following
    directives:

    \badcode
    #include <Qt3DCore>
    #include <Qt3DRender>
    #include <Qt3DInput>
    #include <Qt3DLogic>
    \endcode

    A Qt Quick application requires also additional dependencies:

    \badcode
    QT += 3dcore 3drenderer 3dinput qml quick 3dquick
    \endcode

    \section1 Overview

    The high level design and motivation for Qt 3D is described in the \l {Qt 3D
    Overview}. The Qt 3D Render aspect offers support for data-driven
    configuration as described in \l {Qt 3D Render Framegraph}.
