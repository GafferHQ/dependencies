    \title Qt 3D Render C++ Classes
    \brief The Qt 3D Render module contains functionality to support 2D and 3D
           rendering using Qt 3D.

    \ingroup modules
    \ingroup qt3d-modules
    \qtvariable 3drender

    The Qt 3D Render module provides an aspect, components, and other supporting types necessary
    to implement 2D and 3D rendering as part of the Qt 3D framework.

    To use classes from this module, add this directive into the C++ files:

    \code
       #include <Qt3DRender>
    \endcode

    To link against the corresponding C++ library, add the following to your qmake project file:

    \badcode
       QT += 3drender
    \endcode

    Classes, types, and functions are declared under the \l [Qt3DRender]{Qt3DRender} namespace.

    \section1 Overview

    The Qt 3D Render aspect offers support for data-driven configuration as described
    in \l {Qt 3D Render Framegraph}.
