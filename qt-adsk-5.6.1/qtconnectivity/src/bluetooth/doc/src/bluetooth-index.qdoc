\title Qt Bluetooth
\brief Qt Bluetooth enables connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.
\ingroup technology-apis

The Bluetooth API provides connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.

Currently, the API is supported on the following platforms: \l{Qt for Android}{Android},
\l{Qt for iOS}{iOS}, \l{Qt for Linux/X11}{Linux}
(\l{http://www.bluez.org}{BlueZ 4.x/5.x}) and \l{Qt for OS X}{OS X}.

\section1 Overview

Bluetooth is a short-range (less than 100 meters) wireless technology. It
has a reasonably high data transfer rate of 2.1 Mbit/s, which makes it ideal
for transferring data between devices. Bluetooth connectivity is based on
basic device management, such as scanning for devices, gathering information
about them, and exchanging data between them.

Qt 5.5 contains the first full release of the new Qt Bluetooth
Low Energy API. Further details can be found in the
\l {Bluetooth Low Energy Overview}{Bluetooth Low Energy Overview} section.

\section1 Getting Started

To use the C++ library in your application, add the following configuration
option to your \c .pro file:

\snippet snippets.pro contacts project modification

To use the classes of the module in your application you need the following
import statement in your \c .qml file:

\snippet doc_src_qtbluetooth.qml import
