The purpose of this project is to concatenate all the BuildLog.htm 
output files from each project into a single output file.

This is useful for compiling with VCExpress using command line build
because VCExpress does not output any single unified build log for the
whole solution. Thus, we need to rely on pieceing together build logs
for each individual project.

If any project is added to the solution it should be made sure that it 
is added to the AssembleLogs.cmd script.
