This directory contains autotests based on Qt Test. In order to run the autotests
reliably, you need to configure a desktop to match the test environment that these
tests are written for.

The tests need network connection and access to an Enginio backend.
To be able to run the tests the following environment variables have to be set:

ENGINIO_API_URL (for example https://api.engin.io/)
ENGINIO_EMAIL_ADDRESS (for example jan.kowalski@email.com)
ENGINIO_LOGIN_PASSWORD (mySecretPassword)

Alternatively ENGINIO_EMAIL_ADDRESS and ENGINIO_LOGIN_PASSWORD can be replaced by:

ENGINIO_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH (for example ~/.enginio/user)

where "user" is a text file with 2 lines containing email and password for example:
jan.kowalski@email.com
mySecretPassword
