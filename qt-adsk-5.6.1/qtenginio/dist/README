Building installers the long way...

Note that building the installer does NOT work when Qt is configured with -developer-build.
It is recommended to use the official Qt sdk packages (http://qt-project.org/downloads).

Linux:
qtbase, qttools, qtscript

./configure -nomake examples -nomake tests -static -release -opensource -confirm-license -prefix `pwd`/../qt-install -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-zlib -no-cups -no-icu -qt-sql-sqlite -no-c++11

actually install all of them!

installer-framework (master branch)
qtbase-static/bin/qmake
make

Run the python script with the desired target qt version and the installer-framework/bin in path.
