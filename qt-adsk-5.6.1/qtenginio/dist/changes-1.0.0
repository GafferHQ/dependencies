Enginio 1.0 introduces many improvements to stability and API compared to previous beta versions.

API Changes
-----------
- backendSecret was removed from EnginioClient (both QML and C++)
- Switched to OAuth2 as authentication mechanism everywhere
  - EnginioBasicAuthentication removed
  - EnginioOAuth2Authentication added
- Many properties and signal&slots argument types changed to better fit QML API
- Simplify working with dynamic roles in C++
- New property in Enginio model qml: rowCount
- ObjectAclOperation and UsergroupMembersOperation JSON api was fixed
- EnginioClient is not exposed to QML directly anymore
- Renamed ObjectAclOperation to AccessControlOperation
- Renamed the EnginioClient::search method to fullTextSearch
- Renamed the EnginioClient::downloadFile function to downloadUrl to make it clear that this function does only provide a URL and does not download the file
- Renamed EnginioModel::engino property to client
- Renamed EnginioModel::setProperty to setData for better consistency with other C++ models. The order of the role and value arguments was changed as well
- Renamed Roles to Role in EnginioModelBase. Enums should be singular according to Qt naming policy
- Renamed EnginioClientBase to EnginioClientConnection
- ErrorTypes enum was renamed to ErrorType
- All enums were moved from a class scope to Enginio namespace

Fixed Issues
------------
- It was not possible to add a user to a group with Qt api
- Enums would sometimes not work
- EnginioIdentity would emit userChanged instead of passwordChanged
- Several memory leaks and crashes
- Fixed namespace builds
- Improved documentation
- QNetworkAccessManager is deleted when not needed anymore
- Improved build system
- Improved error messages
- Fixed autocompletion of QML types in QtCreator
- Fixed non-local enums usage in QML
