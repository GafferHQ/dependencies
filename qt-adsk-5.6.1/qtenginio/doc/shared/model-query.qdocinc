\brief The query used to populate the model with data from the backend.

See
//![0]
\l {EnginioClient::query()}
//![1]
documentation for information on how to construct a query.

While the EnginioClient implementation of \c query() returns
the data of a query as a JSON object, for the model the query will be
interpreted as the model data.

Usually, the query is for a single object type and will return all objects
in the database of that type. The model will then represent each returned object
as one row. It can be limited and sorted just like its counterpart
in EnginioClient.

One important thing to note is that the model cannot keep the same sorting as
the backend, and thus sorting and limits are only preserved until
an insertion or deletion happens.
