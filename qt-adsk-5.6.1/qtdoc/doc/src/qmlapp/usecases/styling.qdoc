\title Use Case - Style And Theme Support
\brief Example of how to style user interface components in QML

Styling with QML involves creating a visual type and binding that to a property
or by directly assigning a value to a property. For types that incorporate
Qt Quick's \l{Models and Views in Qt Quick}{delegates} the visual type attaches
to the \e delegate property.

When using \l{Qt Quick Controls}, the controls automatically set
the appropriate style from the respective \l{Community Supported Platforms}{platforms}.

\section1 Using the Styling QML Types

The \l{Qt Quick Controls}{controls} have a \c style property to which the
\e{styling types} bind. The controls have a corresponding styling type from the
\l{Qt Quick Controls Styles QML Types}{Qt Quick Controls Styles} module.
For example, \l Button has a \l ButtonStyle type and \l Menu has a
\l MenuStyle type. The styling types provide properties applicable to their
respective controls such as the background, label, or for some controls, the
cursor appearance.

\note \l{Qt Quick Controls Styles QML Types}{Qt Quick Controls Styles} was
introduced in Qt 5.1 and requires \l{Qt Quick} 2.1.

\section1 Accessing the System Palette

The \l{SystemPalette} type provides information about the system's palette
information. QML applications can use this information to set the appearance
of visual types to match the native look-and-feel. In addition, on
\l{Desktop Platforms}{desktop} platforms, different color palettes are employed
when changing states, for example, when the application loses keyboard focus.

When using the \l{Qt Quick Controls}{controls}, the system colors are already used.
