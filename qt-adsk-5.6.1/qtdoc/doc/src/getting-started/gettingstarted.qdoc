    \title Getting Started with Qt
    \brief A quick guide for developers

    You can install the Qt Framework and tools by using an online or offline
    installer or by building the source packages yourself. In the
    \e{online installer}, you can select the Qt versions, tools, and Add-On
    components to download and install depending on the license attached to your
    \l{Qt Account}.

    An \e{offline installer} is a single package that contains all of Qt and
    Add-Ons relevant for a target platform.

    You can download Qt 5 installers from the \l Downloads page.

    You can use the Qt installers to download and install the following
    components:

    \list
    \li Qt libraries, prebuilt for a particular development platform (operating
     system and compiler)
    \li Qt Creator integrated development environment (IDE)
    \li Reference Documentation and examples
    \li Qt in source code form (needed only if you want to build the framework and
      tools yourself)
    \li Add-On components that are relevant for different platforms
    \endlist

    After downloading, start the installer like any executable on the
    development platform.

    To run the installer, you need a Qt Account. You can use your Qt Account
    credentials to sign-in to all Qt services, including the forums and wiki.
    If you do not already have a Qt Account, you can create one during the
    installation process.

    To complete the installation, select the components that you want to install
    and follow the instructions of the installation program.

    Use the Maintenance Tool under \e{<install_dir>} to add components and to
    update or remove installed components.
